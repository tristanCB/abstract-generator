"experiments on fluid systems in micro-/nano-scale solid conveyors have shown
a violation of the no-slip assumption that have been adopted by the classical
fluid mechanics. to correct this mechanics for the fluid slip, various
approaches have been proposed to determine the slip boundary conditions.
however, these approaches have revealed contradictory results for a variety of
systems, and a debate on the mechanisms and the conditions of the fluid
slip/no-slip past solid surfaces is sustained for a long time. in this paper,
we establish the hybrid continuum-molecular modeling (hcmm) as a general
approach of modeling the fluid slip flow under the influence of excess
fluid-solid molecular interactions. this modeling approach postulates that
fluids flow over solid surfaces with/without slip depending on the difference
between the applied impulse on the fluid and a drag due to the excess
fluid-solid molecular interactions. in the hcmm, the navier-stokes equations
are corrected for the excess fluid-solid interactions. measures of the
fluid-solid interactions are incorporated into the fluid viscosity. we
demonstrate that the correction of the fluid mechanics by the slip boundary
conditions is not an accurate approach, as the fluid-solid interactions would
impact the fluid internally. to show the effectiveness of the proposed hcmm, it
is implemented for water flow in nanotubes. the hcmm is validated by an
extensive comparison with over 90 cases of experiments and molecular dynamics
simulations of different fluid systems. we foresee that the hybrid
continuum-molecular modeling of the fluid slip flow will find many important
implementations in fluid mechanics.

"the dilute fluid phase of model globular proteins is studied. the model
possesses a fluid-fluid transition buried within the fluid-crystal coexistence
region, as do some globular proteins. if this fluid-fluid transition is not
buried deep inside the fluid-crystal coexistence region the crystalline phase
does not nucleate within the dilute fluid. we link this lack of nucleation of
the crystal to the interactions in our model and speculate that similar
interactions between globular proteins are responsible for the difficulty found
in crystallising many globular proteins.

"to study the possibility of a fluid-fluid phase transition, we analyze a
three-dimensional soft-core isotropic potential for a one-component system. we
utilize two independent numerical approaches, (i) integral equation in the
hypernetted-chain approximation and (ii) molecular dynamics simulations, and
find for both approaches a fluid-fluid phase transition as well as the
conventional gas-liquid critical point. we also study the possible existence of
a triple point in the supercooled fluid phase at which three phases---gas,
high-density fluid, and low-density fluid---coexist.

"we present a phenomenological fluid dynamics model for a dilatant fluid, i.e.
a severe shear thickening fluid, by introducing a state variable. the
navier-stokes equation is coupled with the state variable field, which evolves
in response to the local shear stress as the fluid is sheared. the viscosity is
assumed to depend upon the state variable and to diverge at a certain value due
to jamming. we demonstrate that the coupling of the fluid dynamics with the
shear thickening leads to an oscillatory instability in the shear flow. the
model also shows a peculiar response of the fluid to a strong external impact.

"numerous natural processes are contingent on microorganisms' ability to swim
through fluids with non-newtonian rheology. here, we use the model organism
caenorhabditis elegans and tracking methods to experimentally investigate the
dynamics of undulatory swimming in shear-thinning fluids. theory and simulation
have proposed that the cost of swimming, or mechanical power, should be lower
in a shear-thinning fluid compared to a newtonian fluid of the same zero-shear
viscosity. we aim to provide an experimental investigation into the cost of
swimming in a shear-thinning fluid from (i) an estimate of the mechanical power
of the swimmer and (ii) the viscous dissipation rate of the flow field, which
should yield equivalent results for a self-propelled low reynolds number
swimmer. we find the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids is less than or
equal to the cost of swimming in newtonian fluids of the same zero-shear
viscosity; furthermore, the cost of swimming in shear-thinning fluids scales
with a fluid's effective viscosity and can be predicted using fluid rheology
and simple swimming kinematics. our results agree reasonably well with previous
theoretical predictions and provide a framework for understanding the cost of
swimming in generalized newtonian fluids.

that we refer to as activated fluids, namely fluids that behave as an euler
fluid prior activation and behave as a viscous fluid once activation takes
place. we also present a classification concerning boundary conditions that are
viewed as the constitutive relations on the boundary. in the second part of the

"we propose fluid equivalences to compare and reduce behaviour of labeled
fluid stochastic petri nets (lfspns) while preserving their discrete and
continuous properties. we define a linear-time relation of fluid trace
equivalence and its branching-time counterpart, fluid bisimulation equivalence.
both fluid relations take into account the essential features of the lfspns
behaviour: functional activity, stochastic timing and fluid flow. we consider
the lfspns whose continuous markings have no influence to the discrete ones and
whose discrete part is continuous time stochastic petri nets. the underlying
stochastic model for the discrete part of the lfspns is continuous time markov
chains (ctmcs). the performance analysis of the continuous part of lfspns is
accomplished via the associated stochastic fluid models (sfms). we show that
fluid trace equivalence preserves average potential fluid change volume for the
transition sequences of every certain length. we prove that fluid bisimulation
equivalence preserves the aggregated probability functions: stationary
probability mass for the underlying ctmc, as well as stationary fluid buffer
empty probability, fluid density and distribution for the associated sfm.
hence, the equivalence guarantees identity of a number of discrete and
continuous performance measures. fluid bisimulation equivalence is then used to
simplify the qualitative and quantitative analysis of lfspns via quotienting
the discrete reachability graph and underlying ctmc. to describe the quotient
associated sfm, the quotients of the probability functions are defined. we
characterize logically fluid trace and bisimulation equivalences with two novel
fluid modal logics $hml_{flt}$ and $hml_{flb}$, based on the hennessy-milner
logic hml. the application example of a document preparation system
demonstrates the behavioural analysis via quotienting by fluid bisimulation

"surface tension gradients induce marangoni flow, which may be exploited for

examined. as the fluid-fluid critical point is approached, the number of
molecules in the critical nucleus, the nucleus at the top of the free energy
barrier to nucleation, is found to diverge as the isothermal compressibility.
this divergence is due to a layer of the fluid phase of width equal to the
fluid's correlation length which surrounds the core of the nucleus; the number
of molecules in a crystalline environment in the nucleus does not diverge. the
free energy barrier to nucleation remains finite but its derivative with
respect to the chemical potential is equal to minus the number of molecules in

"an important aspect of computational fluid dynamics is related to the

"a key issue in fluid dynamics is the definition of the phase-space lagrangian
dynamics characterizing prescribed ideal fluids (i.e., continua), which is
related to the dynamics of so-called \textit{ideal tracer particles} moving in
the same fluids. these are by definition particles of infinitesimal size which
do not produce significant perturbations of the fluid fields and do not
interact among themselves. in this work we point out that the phase-space
lagrangian description of incompressible navier-stokes fluids can be achieved
by means of a particular subset of ideal tracer particles, denoted as thermal
particles. for these particles the magnitude of their relative velocities -
with respect to the local fluid velocity - is solely determined by the kinetic
pressure, in turn, uniquely related to the fluid pressure. the dynamics of
thermal tracer particles is shown to generate the time-evolution of the fluid
fields by means of a suitable statistical model. the result is reached
introducing a 1-d statistical description of the fluid exclusively based on the
ensemble of thermal tracer particles. in particular, it is proven that the
statistic of thermal particles can be uniquely defined requiring that for these
particles the directions of their initial relative velocities are defined by a
suitable family of random coplanar unit vectors.

"this paper concerns the dynamics of two layers of compressible, barotropic,
viscous fluid lying atop one another. the lower fluid is bounded below by a
rigid bottom, and the upper fluid is bounded above by a trivial fluid of
constant pressure. this is a free boundary problem: the interfaces between the
fluids and above the upper fluid are free to move. the fluids are acted on by
gravity in the bulk, and at the free interfaces we consider both the case of
surface tension and the case of no surface forces. we establish a sharp
nonlinear global-in-time stability criterion and give the explicit decay rates
to the equilibrium. when the upper fluid is heavier than the lower fluid along
the equilibrium interface, we characterize the set of surface tension values in
which the equilibrium is nonlinearly stable. remarkably, this set is non-empty,
i.e. sufficiently large surface tension can prevent the onset of the
rayleigh-taylor instability. when the lower fluid is heavier than the upper

tensions and we establish the zero surface tension limit.

cylinder is studied theoretically. attention is given to the onset of
non-newtonian free-surface instability in creeping flow. this non-inertial
instability has been observed in experiments, but current theoretical models of
newtonian fluids can neither describe its origin nor explain its onset. this
study examines two models of non newtonian fluids to see if the experimentally
observed instability can be predicted analytically. the non-newtonian viscosity
and elastic properties of the fluid are described by the generalized newtonian
fluid (gnf) and second order viscoelastic fluid (sovf) constitutive models,
respectively. with linear stability analysis, it is found that, analogously to
the newtonian fluid, rimming flow of viscous non-newtonian fluids (modeled by
gnf) is neutrally stable. however, the viscoelastic properties of the fluid
(modeled by sovf) are found to contribute to the flow destabilization. the
instability is shown to increase as the cylinder rotation rate is lowered, from
which the fluid accumulates in a pool on the rising wall. viscoelastic effects
coupled with this pooling cause the fluid's angular stretching, which is
suggested to be responsible for this onset of instability.

"the success of spectroscopy to characterise equilibrium fluids, for example
the heat capacity ratio, suggests a parallel approach for active fluids. here,
we start from a hydrodynamic description of chiral active fluids composed of
spinning constituents and derive their low-frequency, long-wavelength response
functions using the kadanoff-martin formalism. we find that the presence of odd
(equivalently, hall) viscosity leads to mixed density-vorticity response even
at linear order. such response, prohibited in time-reversal-invariant fluids,
is a large-scale manifestation of the microscopic breaking of time-reversal
symmetry. our work suggests possible experimental probes that can measure

this report we present a generalized description of the various phase

  at first the nature of every petroleum fluid is presented. their constituents
including their socalled impurities are identified and categorized. heavy
fractions in petroleum fluids are discussed and their main families of
constituents are presented including petroleum wax, diamondoids, asphaltenes
and petroleum resins. then the generalized petroleum fluids phase behavior is
discussed in light of the known theory of phase transitions. the effects of
variations of composition, temperature and pressure on the phase behavior of
petroleum fluids are introduced. finally eleven distinct phase-transition
points of petroleum fluids are presented and their relation with state
variables and constituents of petroleum fluids are identified. this report is
to generalize and relate phase behaviors of all the seven naturally occurring

"we use the enskog theory for the description of the self-diffusion
coefficient of hard sphere fluids in disordered porous media. using the scaled
particle theory previously developed by us for the description of thermodynamic
properties of hard sphere fluids, simple analytical expressions for the contact
values of the fluid-fluid and fluid-matrix pair distribution functions are
obtained and used as the input of enskog theory. the expressions obtained for
the contact values are described only by the geometric porosity and do not
include the dependence on other types of porosity that are important for the
description of thermodynamic properties. it is shown that the application of
such contact values neglects the effects of trapping of fluid particles by a
matrix and at least the probe particle porosity $\phi$ should be included in
the enskog theory for a correct description of the matrix influence. in this
paper we extend the enskog theory by changing the contact values of the
fluid-matrix and the fluid-fluid pair distribution functions with new
properties which include the dependence not only on geometric porosity but also
on probe particle porosity $\phi$. it is shown that such semi-empirical
improvement of the enskog theory corresponds to spt2b1 approximation for the

influence of porous media on the diffusion coefficient of a hard sphere fluid
in disordered porous media. good agreement with computer simulations is

"it is well known that the increase of the spatial dimensionality enhances the
fluid-fluid demixing of a binary mixture of hard hyperspheres, i.e. the
demixing occurs for lower mixture size asymmetry as compared to the
three-dimensional case. however, according to simulations, in the latter
dimension the fluid-fluid demixing is metastable with respect to the
fluid-solid transition. according to the results obtained from approximations
to the equation of state of hard hyperspheres in higher dimensions, the
fluid-fluid demixing might becomes stable for high enough dimension. however,
this conclusion is rather speculative since none of the above works have taken
into account the stability of the crystalline phase (nor by a minimization of a
given density functional, neither spinodal calculations or mc simulations). of
course, the lack of results is justified by the difficulty for performing
density functional calculations or simulations in high dimensions and, in
particular, for highly asymmetric binary mixtures. in the present work, we will
take advantage of a well tested theoretical tool, namely the fundamental
measure density functional theory for parallel hard hypercubes (in the
continuum and in the hypercubic lattice). with this, we have calculated the
fluid-fluid and fluid-solid spinodals for different spatial dimensions. we have
obtained, no matter of the dimensionality, the mixture size asymmetry nor the
polydispersity (included as a bimodal distribution function centered around the
asymmetric edge-lengths), that the fluid-fluid critical point is always located
above the fluid-solid spinodal. in conclusion, these results point to the
existence of demixing between at least one solid phase rich in large particles
and one fluid phase rich in small ones, preempting a fluid-fluid demixing,
independently of the spatial dimension or the polydispersity.

"we present a detailed guide to advanced collisionless fluid models that
incorporate kinetic effects into the fluid framework, and that are much closer
to the collisionless kinetic description than traditional magnetohydrodynamics.
such fluid models are directly applicable to modeling turbulent evolution of a
vast array of astrophysical plasmas, such as the solar corona and the solar
wind, the interstellar medium, as well as accretion disks and galaxy clusters.

divided into two parts. part 1 is dedicated to fluid models that are obtained
by closing the fluid hierarchy with simple (non landau fluid) closures. part 2
is dedicated to landau fluid closures. here in part 1, we discuss the cgl fluid
model in great detail, together with fluid models that contain dispersive
effects introduced by the hall term and by the finite larmor radius (flr)
corrections to the pressure tensor. we consider dispersive effects introduced
by the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors. we investigate the parallel and
oblique firehose instability, and show that the non-gyrotropic heat flux
strongly influences the maximum growth rate of these instabilities.
furthermore, we discuss fluid models that contain evolution equations for the
gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations and that are closed at the 4th-moment level
by prescribing a specific form for the distribution function. for the
bi-maxwellian distribution, such a closure is known as the ""normal"" closure. we
also discuss a fluid closure for the bi-kappa distribution. finally, by
considering one-dimensional maxwellian fluid closures at higher-order moments,
we show that such fluid models are always unstable. the last possible non
landau fluid closure is therefore the ""normal"" closure, and beyond the

for example, when one-dimensional plane-waves appear to be left-moving with
respect to one fluid, but right-moving with respect to another. the dispersion
relation of the two-fluid system is studied for different two-fluid equations
of state: (i) the ""free"" (where there is no direct coupling between the fluid

linear combinations of the velocities) cases are considered in a
frame-independent fashion (eg. no restriction to the rest-frame of either

for a two-fluid system to be causal and absolutely stable and establish a new

are explored numerically in an oldroyd-b fluid for finite deborah numbers while
the small deborah number limit is investigated analytically using a

freezing. however, for a hard-dumbbell length larger than 15% of disk diameter,
there is evidence that fluid-to-solid transition may change to continuous

"viscous flows in a quasi-two-dimensional hele-shaw geometry can lead to an
interfacial instability when one fluid, of viscosity $\eta_{in}$ displaces
another of higher viscosity, $\eta_{out}$. recent studies have shown that there
is a delay in the onset of fingering in miscible fluids as the viscosity ratio,
$\eta_{in}/\eta_{out}$, increases and approaches unity; the interface can
remain stable even though the displacing liquid is less viscous. this paper
shows that a delayed onset and stable pattern can occur in immiscible fluids as
well. however, there are two significant differences between the two cases.
first, in miscible fluids, stable patterns are obtained whenever
$\eta_{in}/\eta_{out} > 0.33$ while in immiscible fluids, the radius at which
the onset of fingering starts, $r_{onset}$, increases steadily until
$\eta_{in}/\eta_{out}=1$. a stable pattern is obtained only when the total size
of the plate used is smaller than $r_{onset}$. second, once the delayed
fingering starts in immiscible fluids, the fingers grow faster than the central
circular region. in miscible fluids, there is a regime in which the fingers and
the central region grow in proportion to each other. these differences between
miscible and immiscible fingering are maintained even when we compare
immiscible fluids that have very low interfacial tension with miscible fluids
that have negligible diffusion.

saturated by a fractional derivative maxwellian fluid, and the analytical
expression of the p- and s-wave dispersion/attenuation is presented. numerical

a significant influence on wave velocities and causes the fluid-solid coupling
transition from a dissipative regime to an elastic regime. in addition, the
predicted fluid velocities are consistent with the laboratory observations of
viscoelastic fluids under an oscillating pressure gradient. the results
indicate that a viscous-elastic fluid effect may account for the velocity

of two point increments of the fluid variables of each species, electric and

can determine non-linear solutions to this problem in the long wavelength
regime. on the boundary we find a conformal fluid with dirichlet constitutive
relations, viz., the fluid propagates on a `dynamical' background metric which
depends on the local fluid velocities and temperature. this boundary fluid can
be re-expressed as an emergent hypersurface fluid which is non-conformal but
has the same value of the shear viscosity as the boundary fluid. the
hypersurface dynamics arises as a collective effect, wherein effects of the
background are transmuted into the fluid degrees of freedom. furthermore, we
demonstrate that this collective fluid is forced to be non-relativistic below a
critical cut-off radius in ads to avoid acausal sound propagation with respect
to the hypersurface metric. we further go on to show how one can use this

a variety of eukaryotic cells and deform in a wavelike fashion to transport

biology, we address mathematically the role of shear-dependent viscosities on
both the waving flagellar locomotion and ciliary transport by metachronal
waves. using a two-dimensional waving sheet as model for the kinematics of a
flagellum or an array of cilia, and allowing for both normal and tangential
deformation of the sheet, we calculate the flow field induced by a
small-amplitude deformation of the sheet in a generalized newtonian carreau
fluid up to order four in the dimensionless waving amplitude. shear-thinning
and shear-thickening fluids are seen to always induce opposite effects. when
the fluid is shear-thinning, the rate of working of the sheet against the fluid
is always smaller than in the newtonian fluid, and the largest gain is obtained
for antiplectic metachronal waves. considering a variety of deformation
kinematics for the sheet, we further show that in all cases transport by the
sheet is more efficiency in a shear-thinning fluid, and in most cases the
transport speed in the fluid is also increased. comparing the order of
magnitude of the shear-thinning contributions with past work on elastic effects
as well as the magnitude of the newtonian contributions, our theoretical
results suggest that the impact of shear-dependent viscosities on transport
could play a major biological role.

exists friction between the normal-fluid and superfluid currents. due to this
friction, part of the superfluid becomes viscous. therefore, a three-fluid

stationary magnetic response, at $v_s<v_l$ with only the non-viscous
superfluid, the meissner supercurrent is excited and the gap equation can
reduce to ginzburg-landau equation. at $v_s{\ge}v_l$, with the normal fluid,
non-viscous and viscous superfluids, in addition to the directly excited

to self-propulsion in a newtonian fluid occurring at a velocity u_n, the sheet
swims (or transports fluid) with velocity u / u_n = [1+de^2 (eta_s)/(eta)

are valid for both waves of tangential and normal motion. the generalization to

"while significant research has been dedicated to the simulation of fluids,
not much attention has been given to exploring new interesting behavior that
can be generated with the different types of non-newtonian fluids with
non-constant viscosity. going in this direction, this paper introduces a
computational model for simulating the interesting phenomena observed in
non-newtonian shear thickening fluids, which are fluids where the viscosity
increases with increased stress. these fluids have unique and unconventional
behavior, and they often appear in real world scenarios such as when sinking in
quicksand or when experimenting with popular cornstarch and water mixtures.
while interesting behavior of shear thickening fluids can be easily observed in
the real world, the most interesting phenomena of these fluids have not been
simulated before in computer graphics. the fluid exhibits unique phase changes
between solid and liquid states, great impact resistance in its solid state and
strong hysteresis effects. our proposed approach builds on existing
non-newtonian fluid models in computer graphics and introduces an efficient
history-based stiffness term that is essential to produce the most interesting
shear thickening phenomena. the history-based stiffness is formulated through
the use of fractional derivatives, leveraging the fractional calculus ability
to depict both the viscoelastic behavior and the history effects of
history-dependent systems. simulations produced by our method are compared

"we derive from first principles a three-dimensional theory of self-propelled
particle swarming in a viscous fluid environment. our model predicts emergent
collective behavior that depends critically on fluid opacity, mechanism of
self-propulsion, and type of particle-particle interaction. in ""clear fluids""
swimmers have full knowledge of their surroundings and can adjust their
velocities with respect to the lab frame, while in ""opaque fluids,"" they
control their velocities only in relation to the local fluid flow. we also show
that ""social"" interactions that affect only a particle's propensity to swim
towards or away from neighbors induces a flow field that is qualitatively
different from the long-ranged flow fields generated by direct ""physical""
interactions. the latter can be short-ranged but lead to much longer-ranged
fluid-mediated hydrodynamic forces, effectively amplifying the range over which
particles interact. these different fluid flows conspire to profoundly affect
swarm morphology, kinetically stabilizing or destabilizing swarm configurations
that would arise in the absence of fluid. depending upon the overall
interaction potential, the mechanism of swimming (e.g., pushers or pullers),
and the degree of fluid opaqueness, we discover a number of new collective
three-dimensional patterns including flocks with prolate or oblate shapes,
recirculating peloton-like structures, and jet-like fluid flows that entrain
particles mediating their escape from the center of mill-like structures. our
results reveal how the interplay among general physical elements influence

"we use active microrheology to determine the frequency dependent moduli of a
linear viscoelastic fluid in terms of the polymer time constant ($\lambda$),
and the polymer ($\mu_p$) and solvent viscosity ($\mu_s$), respectively. we
measure these parameters from the response function of an optically trapped
brownian probe in the fluid under an external perturbation, and at different
dilutions of the viscoelastic component in the fluid. this is an improvement
over bulk microrheology measurements in viscoelastic stokes-oldroyd b fluids
which determine the complex elastic modulus $g(\omega)$ of the fluid, but do
not, however, reveal the characteristics of the polymer chains and the
newtonian solvent of the complex fluid individually. in a recent work [paul
\textit{et al}., 2018 j. phys. condens. matter \textbf{30} 345101], we
linearized the stokes-oldroyd b fluid model and thereby explicitly formulated
the frequency dependent moduli in terms of ($\mu_p$) and ($\mu_s$), which we
now extend to account for an external sinusoidal force applied to the probe
particle. we measure $\lambda$, $\mu_p$, and $\mu_s$ experimentally, and
compare with existing the $\lambda$ values in the literature for the same fluid
at some of the dilution levels, and obtain good agreement. further, we use
these parameters to calculate the complex elastic modulus of the fluid again at
certain dilutions and verify successfully with existing data. this establishes
our method as an alternate approach in the active microrheology of complex
fluids which should reveal information about the composition of such fluids in
significantly greater detail and high signal to noise.

"in a wide range of applications, microfluidic channels are implemented in
soft substrates. in such configurations, where fluidic inertia and
compressibility are negligible, the propagation of fluids in channels is
governed by a balance between fluid viscosity and elasticity of the surrounding
solid. the viscous-elastic interactions between elastic substrates and
non-newtonian fluids are particularly of interest due to the dependence of
viscosity on the state of the system. in this work, we study the
fluid-structure interaction dynamics between an incompressible non-newtonian
fluid and a slender linearly elastic cylinder under the creeping flow regime.
considering power-law fluids and applying the thin shell approximation for the
elastic cylinder, we obtain a non-homogeneous p-laplacian equation governing
the viscous-elastic dynamics. we present exact solutions for the pressure and
deformation fields for various initial and boundary conditions for both
shear-thinning and shear-thickening fluids. we show that in contrast to stokes'
problem where a compactly supported front is obtained for shear-thickening
fluids, here the role of viscosity is inversed and such fronts are obtained for
shear-thinning fluids. furthermore, we demonstrate that for the case of a step
in inlet pressure, the propagation rate of the front has a $t^{\frac{n}{n+1}}$
dependence on time ($t$), suggesting the ability to indirectly measure the
power-law index ($n$) of shear-thinning liquids through measurements of elastic
deformation.

"self-organization of kinesin-driven, microtubule-based 3d active fluids
relies on the collective dynamics of single microtubules. however, the
connection between macroscopic fluid flows and microscopic motion of
microtubules remains unclear. in this work, the motion of single microtubules
was characterized by means of 2d gliding assays and compared with the flows of
3d active fluids. while the scales of the two systems differ by 1,000x, both
were driven by processive, non-processive or an equal mixture of both molecular
motor proteins. to search for the dynamic correlation between both systems, the
motor activities were tuned by varying temperature and atp concentration, and
the changes in both systems were compared. motor processivity played an
important role in active fluid flows but only when the fluids were nearly
motionless; otherwise, flows were dominated by hydrodynamic resistance
controlled by sample size. furthermore, while the motors' thermal reaction led
active fluids to flow faster with increasing temperature, such temperature
dependence could be reversed by introducing temperature-varying depletants,
emphasizing the potential role of the depletant in designing an active fluid's
temperature response. the temperature response of active fluids was nearly
immediate (<10 sec). such a characteristic enables active fluids to be
controlled with a temperature switch. overall, this work not only clarifies the
role of temperature in active fluid activity, but also sheds light on the
underlying principles of the relationship between the collective dynamics of
active fluids and the dynamics of their constituent single microtubules.

"we use a dynamical systems approach to study bianchi type vi$_0$ cosmological
models containing two tilted $\gamma$-law perfect fluids. the full state space
is 11-dimensional, but the existence of a monotonic function simplifies the

interesting, invariant subspace and find all equilibrium points that are future
stable in the full 11-dimensional state space; these are consequently local
attractors and serve as late-time asymptotes for an open set of tilted type
vi$_0$ models containing two tilted fluids. we find that if one of the fluids
has an equation of state parameter $\gamma<6/5$, the stiffest fluid will be
dynamically insignificant at late times. for the value $\gamma=6/5$ there is a
2-dimensional bifurcation set, and if both fluids are stiffer than $\gamma=6/5$
both fluids will have extreme tilt asymptotically. we investigate the case in
which one fluid is extremely tilting in detail. we also consider the case with
one stiff fluid ($\gamma=2$) close to the initial singularity, and find that

"we investigate through non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations the

modeled as cylindrical structures with solvophilic and solvophobic sites. two
fluids are modeled. the first is a standard lennard jones fluid. the second one
is modeled with a isotropic two-length scale potential, which exhibits in bulk
water-like anomalies. our results indicates distinct dependence of the overall
mass flux for each species of fluid with the number of solvophilic sites for
different nanotubes radii. also, the density and fluid structure are dependent
from the nanotube radius and the solvophilic properties of the nanotube. this
indicates that the presence of a second length scale in the fluid-fluid

chemically functionalized nanotubes with different radius will have distinct

"we review recent work on active colloids or swimmers, such as self-propelled
microorganisms, phoretic colloidal particles, and artificial micro-robotic
systems, moving in fluid-like environments. these environments can be
water-like and newtonian but can frequently contain macromolecules, flexible
polymers, soft cells, or hard particles, which impart complex, nonlinear
rheological features to the fluid. while significant progress has been made on
understanding how active colloids move and interact in newtonian fluids, little
is known on how active colloids behave in complex and non-newtonian fluids. an
emerging literature is starting to show how fluid rheology can dramatically
change the gaits and speeds of individual swimmers. simultaneously, a moving
swimmer induces time dependent, three dimensional fluid flows, that can modify
the medium (fluid) rheological properties. this two-way, non-linear coupling at
microscopic scales has profound implications at meso- and macro-scales: steady
state suspension properties, emergent collective behavior, and transport of
passive tracer particles. recent exciting theoretical results and current
debate on quantifying these complex active fluids highlight the need for
conceptually simple experiments to guide our understanding.

"in the dynamics of viscous fluid, the case of vanishing kinematic viscosity
is actually equivalent to the reynolds number tending to infinity. hence, in
the limit of vanishing viscosity the fluid flow is essentially turbulent. on
the other hand, the euler equation, which is conventionally adopted for
description of flow of inviscid fluid, does not possess proper turbulent
behaviour. this raises the question of the existence of the passage to the
limit of inviscid fluid for real low-viscosity fluids. to address this
question, one should employ the theory of turbulent boundary layer near an
inflexible boundary (e.g., rigid wall). on the basis of this theory, one can
see how the solutions to the euler equation become relevant for the description
of flow of low-viscosity fluids, and obtain the small parameter quantifying
accuracy of this description for real fluids.

"we apply a novel optimization scheme from the image processing and machine
learning areas, a fast primal-dual method, to achieve controllable and
realistic fluid simulations. while our method is generally applicable to many
problems in fluid simulations, we focus on the two topics of fluid guiding and
separating solid-wall boundary conditions. each problem is posed as an
optimization problem and solved using our method, which contains acceleration
schemes tailored to each problem. in fluid guiding, we are interested in
partially guiding fluid motion to exert control while preserving fluid
characteristics. with our method, we achieve explicit control over both
large-scale motions and small-scale details which is valuable for many
applications, such as level-of-detail adjustment (after running the coarse
simulation), spatially varying guiding strength, domain modification, and
resimulation with different fluid parameters. for the separating solid-wall
boundary conditions problem, our method effectively eliminates unrealistic
artifacts of fluid crawling up solid walls and sticking to ceilings, requiring
few changes to existing implementations. we demonstrate the fast convergence of
our primal-dual method with a variety of test cases for both model problems.

"swimming microorganisms often have to propel in complex, non-newtonian
fluids. we carry out experiments with self-propelling helical swimmers driven
by an externally rotating magnetic field in shear-thinning, inelastic fluids.
similarly to swimming in a newtonian fluid, we obtain for each fluid a
locomotion speed which scales linearly with the rotation frequency of the
swimmer, but with a prefactor which depends on the power index of the fluid.
the fluid is seen to always increase the swimming speed of the helix, up to 50%
faster and thus the strongest of such type reported to date. the maximum
relative increase for a fluid power index of around 0.6. using simple scalings,
we argue that the speed increase is not due to the local decrease of the flow
viscosity around the helical filament but hypothesise instead that it
originates from confinement-like effect due to viscosity stratification around
the swimmer.

"formation of recirculating wakes is a prominent feature of inertial flow
around bluff bodies. below the onset of vortex shedding in uniform unbounded
flows, the fluid in the recirculating wake region moves on closed planar
orbits. the steady wake is thus an isolated zone in the flow and does not
exchange fluid with the free stream. in this work, we utilize lattice-boltzmann
simulations and microfluidic experiments to demonstrate that in microchannel
inertial flow of newtonian fluids, the recirculating wake is replaced by a
three-dimensional vortical flow. spiraling streamlines generate a continuous
exchange of fluid between the vortex behind the obstacle and the free stream.
the flow inertia is represented by reynolds number defined as $re =

preferential invasion, with reduced trapping of the defending fluid, especially
at low flow rates. numerically, we find that increasing the correlation length
reduces the fluid-fluid interfacial area and the trapping of the defending
fluid, and increases the invasion pattern asymmetry and selectivity. our

slow viscous flows of incompressible newtonian fluids under the isothermal

in complex fluids, the hydrodynamic flow is coupled with the evolution of
internal degrees of freedom such as the solute concentration in two-phase
binary fluids and the spin in micropolar fluids. the dynamics of complex fluids
can be described by local conservation laws supplemented with local

that only when the viscosity of the fluid above the membrane is sufficiently

"this paper introduces a sharp interface method to simulate fluid-structure
interaction (fsi) involving arbitrary rigid bodies immersed in viscous
incompressible fluids. this approach, which we refer to as an immersed
lagrangian-eulerian (ile) method, integrates aspects of partitioned and
immersed fsi formulations by solving separate momentum equations for the fluid
and solid domains, as in a partitioned formulation, while also using
non-conforming discretizations of the moving fluid and structure, as in an
immersed formulation. a dirichlet-neumann coupling scheme is used, in which the
motion of the immersed solid is driven by fluid traction forces evaluated along
the fluid-structure interface, and the motion of fluid along that interface is
constrained to match the solid velocity, so as to enforce the no-slip
condition. we introduce a penalty approach that weakly imposes the no-slip
condition along the fluid-solid interface. in the coupling strategy, a separate
discretization of the fluid-structure interface is tethered to the volumetric
solid mesh via stiff spring-like penalty forces. our fluid-structure
interaction scheme relies on a recently developed immersed interface method for
discrete geometries, which enables the accurate determination of both
velocities and stresses along the fluid-structure interface. the effectiveness
of this straightforward fsi methodology is extensively tested against benchmark
computational and experimental studies in two and three spatial dimensions,
including for geometries with non-smooth features. unlike commonly used
partitioned methods, which can suffer from so-called added mass effect

another functional: the disorder-averaged free energy plus the fluid-matrix

functional only of the average density profile of the fluid. when the matrix is
created as a quenched configuration of another fluid, the functional can be
regarded as depending on the density profile of the matrix fluid as well. in
this situation, the replica-ornstein-zernike equations which do not contain the

potentials. this fluid is no longer isentropic and there are choices for which
it either obeys the second law of thermodynamics or not. a mass term of the
correct sign occurs for the $a$ term in the stress, and this mass term depends
on the potentials in the above vector. the charged fluid can be reduced to

employing the modified formulation of the pkn problem we obtain its simple
analytical solutions in the cases of perfectly plastic and newtonian fluids.
since the results for shear thinning fluids are intermediate between those for
these cases, the obtained equation for the fracture length suggests a criterion
of the equivalence of various shear thinning fluids for the problem of
hydraulic fractures. we assume fluids equivalent in their hydrofracturing
action, when at a reference time they produce fractures of the same length. the
equation for the fracture length translates the equivalence in terms of the
hydraulic fracture length and treatment time into the equivalence in terms of
the properties of a fracturing fluid (behavior and consistency indices).
analysis shows that the influence of the consistency and behavior indices on
the fracture length, particle velocity and propagation speed is quite similar
when considering the pkn and kgd models despite the models refer to different

differences between thinning fluids are not significant; they may be taken into
account when wishing to have some quantity to be greater (less) at small

consider the possibilities that this coating was created through: a surface
tension driven landau levitch derjaguin wetting of the surface; a
visco-inertial quick coating; or alternatively through the inertia of the fluid
moving with the ball through the reservoir. we show that although the pinch-off
mechanism is controlled by viscosity, the coating mechanism is governed by a
different length and timescale, dictated by the inertial added mass of the ball

"we present a novel partitioned iterative formulation for modeling of
fluid-structure interaction in two-phase flows. the variational formulation
consists of a stable and robust integration of three blocks of differential
equations, viz., incompressible viscous fluid, a rigid or flexible structure
and two-phase indicator field. the fluid-fluid interface between the two
phases, which may have high density and viscosity ratios, is evolved by solving
the conservative phase-field allen-cahn equation in the arbitrary
lagrangian-eulerian coordinates. while the navier-stokes equations are solved
by a stabilized petrov-galerkin method, the conservative allen-chan phase-field
equation is discretized by the positivity preserving variational scheme. fully
decoupled implicit solvers for the two-phase fluid and the structure are
integrated by the nonlinear iterative force correction in a staggered
partitioned manner. we assess the accuracy and stability of the new
phase-field/ale variational formulation for two- and three-dimensional problems
involving the dynamical interaction of rigid bodies with free-surface. we
consider the decay test problems of increasing complexity, namely free
translational heave decay of a circular cylinder and free rotation of a
rectangular barge. through numerical experiments, we show that the proposed
formulation is stable and robust for high density ratios across fluid-fluid
interface and for low structure-to-fluid mass ratio with strong added-mass
effects. using three-dimensional unstructured meshes, we demonstrate the
second-order temporal accuracy of the coupled phase-field/ale method. finally,
we demonstrate the three-dimensional phase-field fsi formulation for a
practical problem of internal two-phase flow in a flexible circular pipe
subjected to vortex-induced vibrations due to external fluid flow.

mechanopathological parameters of great clinical significance. to date, there
is a lack of non-invasive techniques that can be used to estimate these

ratio between vp and ip and the ratio between the peak ifp and effective
vascular pressure in the tumor. finally, we demonstrated that axial strain time

"due to evergrowing importance of understanding flow of bio-fluids in
lab-on-cd based systems, we investigate the flow behaviour of power-law fluids
in the rotating electroosmotic flow through a polyelectrolyte grafted (soft)
narrow channel. we use a in-house numerical code to solve the governing
transport equations for the velocities and flow rates in a rotating channel
subjected to an applied external electric field. we show the strong effect of
polyelectrolyte layer on the flow behaviour and find an increase in flow rate
as we increase the size of the polyelectrolyte layer. we also show that
rheology strongly influences the interplay of the coriolis forces due to
rotation and electrical body force due to the applied electric field. we show
that the velocities are generally higher for shear thinning fluids as compared
to shear thickening fluids. we also show that presence of polymer brushes in
the polyelectrolyte layer creates a drag on the fluid which reduces velocities.
we also show that the flow rates are strongly altered by the effect of rotation
and that shear thickening fluids have lower flow rates than shear thinning
fluids. we believe that studying effect of fluid rheology becomes very
important for designing soft channel based lab-on-cd systems driven by

oscillations of a two-fluid star about static (non-rotating) configurations.
such a formalism is intended for neutron stars, whose matter content can be
described, as a first approximation, by a two-fluid model: one fluid is the
neutron superfluid, which is believed to exist in the core and inner crust of
mature neutron stars; the other fluid is a conglomerate of all other
constituents (crust nuclei, protons, electrons, etc...). we obtain a system of
equations which govern the perturbations both of the metric and of the matter
variables, whatever the equation of state for the two fluids. as a first
application, we consider the simplified case of two non-interacting fluids,
each with a polytropic equation of state. we compute numerically the
quasi-normal modes (i.e. oscillations with purely outgoing gravitational
radiation) of the corresponding system. when the adiabatic indices of the two
fluids are different, we observe a splitting for each frequency of the
analogous single fluid spectrum. the analysis also substantiates the claim that
w-modes are largely due to spacetime oscillations.

there are, however, at least two obstructions to the generalization of such

the natural energy does not correspond to a proper functional norm on

fluctuations in oldroyd-b fluids may be subject to non-normal amplification at
arbitrarily low reynolds numbers (albeit at sufficiently large weissenberg

"the climbing effect of a viscoelastic fluid when stirred by a spinning rod is
well documented and known as weissenberg effect(wei et al, 2006). this
phenomenon is related to the elasticity of the fluid. we have observed that
this effect can appear when the fluid is stirred without a rod. in this work, a
comparison of the flow around a spinning disk for a newtonian and a
non-newtonian liquids is presented. the flow is visualized with ink and small
bubbles as fluid path tracers. for a newtonian fluid, at the center of the
spinning disk, the fluid velocity is directed towards the disk (sink flow); on
the other hand, for a viscoelatic liquid, a source flow is observed since the
fluid emerges from the disk. the toroidal vortices that appear on top of the
disk rotate in opposite directions for the newtonian and non-newtonian cases.
similar observations have been reported for the classical rod climbing flow
(siginer, 1984 and escudier, 1984). some authors have suggested that this flow

of variables requires to be stiff too. the fluids are interacting only
gravitationally and their energy momentum tensors are separately conserved. the
einstein equations are reduced to a single nonlinear ode of second order which
is shown to lead to an abel ode. a few particular exact solutions were found
using a polynomial ansatz. the two non-comoving gravitational sources in the
solutions can be interpreted either as scalar fields or stiff fluids. a
complete analysis is performed on the range of parameters for which the stiff
fluid interpretation is physically acceptable. general formulas are derived for
the conformal vectors of the solutions. by making the second fluid vanish, a

reminiscent of the rod-climbing effect. on this relaxation time-scale, the flow
also transitions from being initially newtonian-like to one where the fluids'
elasticity plays a dynamical role: the fluid cells oscillate with regularity in
position and shape on a timescale much longer than the relaxation time. as the

possess a polymeric microstructure, we address here synchronization in a
viscoelastic fluid analytically. using a two-dimensional infinite sheet model
we show that the presence of polymeric stresses removes the geometrical
asymmetry constraint, and therefore even symmetric swimmers synchronize. such
synchronization occurs on asymptotically faster time scales than in a newtonian
fluid, and the swimmers are seen to be driven into a stable in-phase

a highly periodic swimming behavior as the fluid viscosity is varied from 1.0
mpa-s to 12 mpa-s. surprisingly, the nematode's swimming speed (~0.35 mm/s) is
nearly insensitive to the range of fluid viscosities investigated here.
however, the nematode's beating frequency decreases to an asymptotic value
(~1.7 hz) with increasing fluid viscosity. a simple model is used to estimate
the nematode's young's modulus and tissue viscosity. both material properties
increase with increasing fluid viscosity. it is proposed that the increase in
young's modulus may be associated with muscle contraction in response to larger

in turbulence are based on phase-locked parameters linked with the development
of secondary flows rather than on time-averaged wall parameters. this
similarity analysis collapses the local critical instantaneous friction factor
data of both newtonian and non-newtonian fluids at the point of bursting into a

"correspondences between black holes and fluids have been discussed in two
different frameworks, the fluid/gravity correspondence and membrane paradigm.
recently, it has been discussed that these two theories can be understood as
the same theory if the cutoff surface is placed slightly outside the horizon.
the bulk viscosity is different for these two theories, but it does not
contribute to physics since the fluid becomes incompressible in the near
horizon limit. in the ads/cft correspondence, it is known that the fluid
becomes compressible and the bulk viscosity is zero, apart from the near
horizon limit. in this paper, we consider the fluid/gravity correspondence in
asymptotically non-ads geometries. we put the cutoff surface near but at a
finite distance from the horizon. then, the model becomes the membrane paradigm
with compressible fluid. we show that the bulk viscosity is not negative at
least within the linear response regime. we also discuss the higher derivative
corrections in the stress-energy tensor.

"we use a 3d computational model to study the fluid transport and mixing due
to the beating of an infinite array of cilia. in accord with recent
experiments, we observe two distinct regions: a fluid transport region above
the cilia and a fluid mixing region below the cilia tip. the metachronal wave
due to phase differences between neighboring cilia is known to enhance the
fluid transport above the ciliary tip. in this work, we show that the
metachronal wave also enhances the mixing rates in the sub-ciliary region,
often simultaneously with the flow rate enhancement. our results suggest that
this simultaneous enhancement in transport and mixing is due to an enhancement
in shear flow. as the flow above the cilia increases, shear rate in the fluid
increases and such shear enhances stretching, which is an essential ingredient
for mixing. estimates of the mixing time scale indicate that, compared to
diffusion, the mixing due to the cilia beat may be significant and sometimes
dominates chemical diffusion.

"it is known that the eulerian and lagrangian structures of fluid flow can be
drastically different; for example, ideal fluid flow can have a trivial
(static) eulerian structure, while displaying chaotic streamlines. here we show
that ideal flow with limited spatial smoothness (an initial vorticity that is
just a little better than continuous), nevertheless has time-analytic
lagrangian trajectories before the initial limited smoothness is lost. for
proving such results we use a little-known lagrangian formulation of ideal
fluid flow derived by cauchy in 1815 in a manuscript submitted for a prize of
the french academy. this formulation leads to simple recurrence relations among
the time-taylor coefficients of the lagrangian map from initial to current
fluid particle positions; the coefficients can then be bounded using elementary
methods. we first consider various classes of incompressible fluid flow,
governed by the euler equations, and then turn to a case of compressible flow
of cosmological relevance, governed by the euler-poisson equations.

"we use confocal microscopy to directly visualize the simultaneous flow of
both a wetting and a non-wetting fluid through a model three-dimensional (3d)
porous medium. we find that, for small flow rates, both fluids flow through
unchanging, distinct, connected 3d pathways; in stark contrast, at sufficiently
large flow rates, the non-wetting fluid is broken up into discrete ganglia. by
performing experiments over a range of flow rates, using fluids of different
viscosities, and with porous media having different geometries, we show that
this transition can be characterized by a state diagram that depends on the
capillary numbers of both fluids, suggesting that it is controlled by the
competition between the viscous forces exerted on the flowing oil and the
capillary forces at the pore scale. our results thus help elucidate the diverse

"the motion of incompressible fractional oldroyd-b fluids between two parallel
walls perpendicular to a plate that applies time-dependent shear stresses to
the fluid is studied by means of integral transforms. in the special cases of
newtonian and second grade fluids, these shear stresses reduces to fh(t)sin(wt)

newtonian solutions and the corresponding non-newtonian contributions. they
reduce to the similar solutions corresponding to the motion over an infinite
plate if the distance between walls tend to infinity and can be easy
particularized to give the similar solutions for ordinary and fractional
maxwell or second grade fluids performing the same motions. as a check of
general results some known solutions from the literature are recovered as
limiting cases. finally, the influence of fractional parameters on the fluid
motion and the distance between walls for which the measured value of the

exactly, it is equal to the velocity corresponding to the motion over an
infinite plate) are graphically determined.

while past theoretical work indicates that fluid viscoelasticity should hinder

non-newtonian enhancement of locomotion. we suggest a physical mechanism, based
on fluid-structure interaction, leading to swimming in a viscoelastic fluid at
a higher speed than in a newtonian one. using taylor's two-dimensional swimming
sheet model, we solve for the shape of an active swimmer as a balance between
the external fluid stresses, the internal driving moments, and the passive
elastic resistance. we show that this dynamic balance leads to a generic
transition from hindered rigid swimming to enhanced flexible locomotion. the
results are physically interpreted as due to a viscoelastic suction increasing
the swimming amplitude in a non-newtonian fluid and overcoming viscoelastic
damping.

shape changes lead to larger amplitude strokes for sufficiently soft swimmers
in a viscoelastic fluid, and these stroke boosts can lead to swimming
speed-ups, but we find that additional effects of fluid elasticity generically
slow down swimmers. high amplitude strokes in strongly elastic flows lead to a

slice stretching between these two surfaces. when applied to the
einstein-perfect fluid system, however, wald's methods yield restricted
results. the reason is that the fluid fields in the lagrangian of a gravitating
perfect fluid are typically nonstationary. we therefore first derive a first
law-like relation for an arbitrary lagrangian metric theory of gravity coupled
to arbitrary lagrangian matter fields, requiring only that the metric field be
stationary. this relation includes a volume integral of matter fields over a

"we report calculations of the density of maximally random jamming (aka random
close packing) of one-component and binary hard disc fluids. the theoretical
structure used provides a common framework for description of the hard disc
liquid to hexatic, the liquid to hexagonal crystal and the liquid-to-maximally
random jammed state transitions. our analysis is based on locating a particular
bifurcation of the solutions of the integral equation for the inhomogeneous
single particle density at the transition between different spatial structures.
the bifurcation of solutions we study is initiated from the dense metastable
fluid, and we associate it with the limit of stability of the fluid, which we
identify with the transition from the metastable fluid to a maximally random
jammed state. for the one-component hard disc fluid the predicted packing
fraction at which the metastable fluid to maximally random jammed state
transition occurs is 0.84, in excellent agreement with the experimental value
0.84 \pm 0.02. the corresponding analysis of the limit of stability of a binary
hard disc fluid with specified disc diameter ratio and disc composition
requires extra approximations in the representations of the direct correlation
function, the equation of state, and the number of order parameters accounted
for. keeping only the order parameter identified with the largest peak in the
structure factor of the highest density regular lattice with the same disc
diameter ratio and disc composition as the binary fluid, the predicted density
of maximally random jamming is found to be 0.84 to 0.87, depending on the
equation of state used, and very weakly dependent on the ratio of disc
diameters and the fluid composition, in agreement with both experimental data
and computer simulation data.

able to allow kinematics that cannot be produced in the presence of fluids that
yield only isotropic pressure. we have obtained well behaving cases where the
anisotropy of the expansion and the anisotropy of the fluid converge to finite

"a key issue in fluid dynamics is the unique definition of the phase-space
lagrangian dynamics characterizing prescribed ideal fluids (i.e., continua),

(itp) moving in the same fluids. these are by definition particles of
infinitesimal size which do not produce significant perturbations of the fluid
fields and do not interact among themselves. for navier-stokes (ns) fluids, the
discovery by tessarotto et al. (2005-2009) of the phase-space dynamical system
advancing in time the state of the fluid, has made possible, \textit{in the

"molecular dynamic (md) simulation is used to study slip at the fluid-solid
boundary in an unsteady flow based on the stokes second problem. an increase in
slip is observed in comparison to the steady flow for shear rates below the
critical shear rate of the corresponding steady flow. this increased slip is
attributed to fluid inertial forces not represented in a steady flow. an
unsteady mathematical model for slip is established, which estimates the
increment in slip at the boundary. the model shows that slip is also dependent
on acceleration in addition to the shear rate of fluid at the wall. by writing
acceleration in terms of shear rate, it is shown that slip at the wall in
unsteady flows is governed by the gradient of shear rate and shear rate of the
fluid. non-dimensionalizing the model gives a universal curve which can be used
to find the slip boundary condition at the fluid-solid interface based on the
information of shear rate and gradient of shear rate of the fluid. a governing
non-dimensional number, defined as the ratio of phase speed to speed of sound,
is identified to help in explaining the mechanism responsible for the
transition of slip boundary condition from finite to a perfect slip and
determining when this would occur. phase lag in fluid velocity relative to wall
is observed. the lag increases with decreasing time period of wall oscillation
and increasing wall hydrophobicity. the phenomenon of hysteresis is seen when
looking into the variation of slip velocity as a function of wall velocity and
slip velocity as a function of fluid shear rate. the cause for hysteresis is
attributed to the unsteady inertial forces of the fluid.

"first, a meshless simulation method is presented for multiphase
fluid-particle flows with a two-way coupled smoothed particle hydrodynamics
(sph) for the fluid and the discrete element method (dem) for the solid phase.
the unresolved fluid model, based on the locally averaged navier stokes
equations, is expected to be considerably faster than fully resolved models.
furthermore, in contrast to similar mesh-based discrete particle methods
(dpms), our purely particle-based method enjoys the flexibility that comes from
the lack of a prescribed mesh. it is suitable for problems such as free surface
flow or flow around complex, moving and/or intermeshed geometries and is
applicable to both dilute and dense particle flows.
  second, a comprehensive validation procedure for fluid-particle simulations
is presented and applied here to the sph-dem method, using simulations of
single and multiple particle sedimentation in a 3d fluid column and comparison
with analytical models. millimetre-sized particles are used along with three
different test fluids: air, water and a water-glycerol solution. the velocity
evolution for a single particle compares well (less than 1% error) with the
analytical solution as long as the fluid resolution is coarser than two times
the particle diameter. two more complex multiple particle sedimentation
problems (sedimentation of a homogeneous porous block and an inhomogeneous
rayleigh taylor instability) are also reproduced well for porosities 0.6 <=
\epsilon <= 1.0, although care should be taken in the presence of high porosity
gradients.

"in 1926, murray proposed the first law for the optimal design of blood
vessels. he minimized the power dissipation arising from the trade-off between
fluid circulation and blood maintenance. the law, based on a constant fluid
viscosity, states that in the optimal configuration the fluid flow rate inside
the vessel is proportional to the cube of the vessel radius, implying that wall
shear stress is not dependent on the vessel radius. murray's law has been found
to be true in blood macrocirculation, but not in microcirculation. in 2005,
alarc\'on et al took into account the non monotonous dependence of viscosity on
vessel radius - f{\aa}hr{\ae}us-lindqvist effect - due to phase separation
effect of blood. they were able to predict correctly the behavior of wall shear
stresses in microcirculation. one last crucial step remains however: to account
for the dependence of blood viscosity on shear rates. in this work, we
investigate how viscosity dependence on shear rate affects murray's law. we
extended murray's optimal design to the whole range of qu\'emada's fluids, that
models pseudo-plastic fluids such as blood. our study shows that murray's
original law is not restricted to newtonian fluids, it is actually universal
for all qu\'emada's fluid as long as there is no phase separation effect. when
phase separation effect occurs, then we derive an extended version of murray's

media have been used to study the mechanical properties of materials, as well
as for mechanical and biological sensing. the medium surrounding the

however suggested that high-frequency longitudinal vibration of bipyramidal
nanoparticles could trigger a viscoelastic response in water-glycerol mixtures

of the purely radial vibration of an elastic sphere, also called the breathing

viscoelastic medium using the maxwell fluid model. the effects of fluid
compressibility and viscoelasticity are discussed. although in the case of
longitudinal vibration of bipyramidal nanoparticles, the effects of fluid
compressibility were shown to be negligible, we demonstrate that it plays a
significant role in the breathing mode of an elastic sphere. on the other hand,
despite the different vibration modes, the breathing mode of a sphere triggers
a viscoelastic response in water-glycerol mixtures similar to that triggered by
the longitudinal vibration of bipyramidal nanoparticles. we also comment on the
effect of fluid viscoelasticity on the idea of destroying virus particles by

"this paper presents a new theory of turbulent mixing in stirred reactors. the
degree of homogeneity of a mixed fluid may be characterized by the kolmogorov
micro-scale. the smaller its value, the better homogeneity. the micro-scale
scales inversely with the fourth root of the energy dissipation rate in the
stirring process. the higher this rate, the smaller lambda, and the better the
homogeneity in the reactor. this is true for newtonian fluids. in non-newtonian
fluids the situation is different. for instance, in shear-thickening fluids it
is plausible that high shear rates thicken the fluid and might strangle the
mixing. the internal interactions between different fluid-mechanical and
colloidal variables are subtle, namely due to the (until recently) very limited
understanding of turbulence. starting from a qualitatively new turbulence
theory for inviscid fluids [baumert, 2013], giving e.g. the karman constant as
$(2\pi)^{-1/2} = 0.40$ [the super-pipe in princeton gave 0.40 p/m 0.02, bailey
et al., 2014], we generalize this approach to the case of viscous fluids and
derive equations which in the steady state exhibit two solutions. one solution
branch describes a state of good mixing, the other a state of strangled
turbulence. the physical system cannot be in two different steady states at the
same time. but it is physically admissible to switch between the two steady
states by non-stationary transitions, maybe in a chaotic fashion.

"the two-fluid maxwell system couples frictionless electron and ion fluids via
maxwell's equations. when the frequencies of light waves, langmuir waves, and
single-particle cyclotron motion are scaled to be asymptotically large, the
two-fluid maxwell system becomes a fast-slow dynamical system. this fast-slow
system admits a formally-exact single-fluid closure that may be computed
systematically with any desired order of accuracy through the use of a
functional partial differential equation. in the leading order approximation,
the closure reproduces magnetohydrodynamics (mhd). higher order truncations of
the closure give an infinite hierarchy of extended mhd models that allow for
arbitrary mass ratio, as well as perturbative deviations from charge
neutrality. the closure is interpreted geometrically as an invariant slow
manifold in the infinite-dimensional two-fluid phase space, on which two-fluid
motions are free of high-frequency oscillations. this perspective shows that
the full closure inherits a hamiltonian structure from two-fluid theory. by
employing infinite-dimensional lie transforms, the poisson bracket for the
all-orders closure may be obtained in closed form. thus, conservative
truncations of the single-fluid closure may be obtained by simply truncating
the single-fluid hamiltonian. moreover, the closed-form expression for the
all-orders bracket gives explicit expressions for a number of the full
closure's conservation laws. notably, the full closure, as well as any of its
hamiltonian truncations, admits a pair of independent circulation invariants.

"fluids confined in nanopores exhibit properties different from the properties
of the same fluids in bulk, among these properties are the isothermal
compressibility or elastic modulus. the modulus of a fluid in nanopores can be
extracted from ultrasonic experiments or calculated from molecular simulations.
using monte carlo simulations in the grand canonical ensemble, we calculated
the modulus for liquid argon at its normal boiling point (87.3~k) adsorbed in
model silica pores of two different morphologies and various sizes. for
spherical pores, for all the pore sizes (diameters) exceeding 2~nm, we obtained
a logarithmic dependence of fluid modulus on the vapor pressure. calculation of
the modulus at saturation showed that the modulus of the fluid in spherical
pores is a linear function of the reciprocal pore size. the calculation of the
modulus of the fluid in cylindrical pores appeared too scattered to make
quantitative conclusions. we performed additional simulations at higher
temperature (119.6~k), at which monte carlo insertions and removals become more
efficient. the results of the simulations at higher temperature confirmed both
regularities for cylindrical pores and showed quantitative difference between
the fluid moduli in pores of different geometries. both of the observed
regularities for the modulus stem from the tait-murnaghan equation applied to
the confined fluid. our results, along with the development of the effective
medium theories for nanoporous media, set the groundwork for analysis of the

we find that the variance of the fluid temperature gradients decreases as the
thermal response time of the suspended particles is increased. the probability
density function (pdf) of the fluid temperature gradients scales with its
variance, while the pdf of the rate of change of the particle temperature,
whose variance is associated with the thermal dissipation due to the particles,
does not scale in such a self-similar way. the modification of the fluid
temperature field due to the particles is examined by computing the particle
concentration and particle heat fluxes conditioned on the magnitude of the
local fluid temperature gradient. these statistics highlight that the particles
cluster on the fluid temperature fronts, and the important role played by the
alignments of the particle velocity and the local fluid temperature gradient.
the temperature structure functions, which characterize the temperature
fluctuations across the scales of the flow, clearly show that the fluctuations
of the fluid temperature increments are monotonically suppressed in the two-way
coupled regime as the particle thermal response time is increased. thermal
caustics dominate the particle temperature increments at small scales, that is,
particles that come into contact are likely to have very large differences in

variations were measured in situ during dynamic rock fracture and frictional
slip under upper crustal stress conditions. during the main rupture, the
on-fault fluid pressure dropped rapidly to zero, indicating partial
vaporisation and/or degassing. further deformation produced stick-slip events
systematically associated with near-instantaneous drops in fluid pressure,
providing direct experimental support of the concept of ``seismic suction
pump''. in situ fluid volume and wave speed measurements together with
microstructural investigations show that dilatancy is the process driving fluid
pressure drops during rupture and slip. extrapolation of the laboratory results
indicate that dilatancy-induced fluid pressure drops might be a widespread

conducting fluids, superfluids, and superfluid neutron star matter. the
equations governing thermally conducting fluids are found to be more general
than the standard description, as the effect of entrainment usually seems to be
overlooked in this context. in the case of superfluid he4 we recover the
landau--khalatnikov equations of the two-fluid model via a translation to the
``orthodox'' framework of superfluidity, which is based on a rather awkward
choice of variables. our two-fluid model for superfluid neutron star matter
allows for dissipation via mutual friction and also ``transfusion'' via
beta-reactions between the neutron fluid and the proton-electron fluid.

"shear-thinning is an important rheological property of many biological
fluids, such as mucus, whereby the apparent viscosity of the fluid decreases
with shear. certain microscopic swimmers have been shown to progress more
rapidly through shear-thinning fluids, but is this behavior generic to all
microscopic swimmers, and what are the physics through which shear-thinning
rheology affects a swimmer's propulsion? we examine swimmers employing
prescribed stroke kinematics in two-dimensional, inertialess carreau fluid:
shear-thinning ""generalized stokes"" flow. swimmers are modeled, using the
method of femlets, by a set of immersed, regularized forces. the equations
governing the fluid dynamics are then discretized over a body-fitted mesh and
solved with the finite element method. we analyze the locomotion of three
distinct classes of microswimmer: (1) conceptual swimmers comprising sliding
spheres employing both one- and two-dimensional strokes, (2) slip-velocity
envelope models of ciliates commonly referred to as ""squirmers"" and (3)
monoflagellate pushers, such as sperm. we find that morphologically identical
swimmers with different strokes may swim either faster or slower in
shear-thinning fluids than in newtonian fluids. we explain this kinematic
sensitivity by considering differences in the viscosity of the fluid
surrounding propulsive and payload elements of the swimmer, and using this
insight suggest two reciprocal sliding sphere swimmers which violate purcell's
scallop theorem in shear-thinning fluids. we also show that an increased flow
decay rate arising from shear-thinning rheology is associated with a reduction
in the swimming speed of slip-velocity squirmers. for sperm-like swimmers, a
gradient of thick to thin fluid along the flagellum alters the force it exerts
upon the fluid, flattening trajectories and increasing instantaneous swimming
speed.

"in this paper, we perform analysis of the fluid velocity vector field
divergence $\nabla \cdot \vec{u}$ derived from the continuity equation, and we
explore its application in the navier-stokes equations for compressible fluids
$\rho (\vec{x},t)\ne const$, occupying all of $\vec{x}\in r^{3} $ space at any
$t\geq 0$. the resulting velocity vector field divergence $\nabla \cdot
\vec{u}=-\frac{1}{\rho } (\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +\vec{u}\cdot
\nabla \rho )$ is a direct consequence of the fluid density rate of change over
time $\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t}$ and over space $\nabla \rho $, in
addition to the fluid velocity vector field $\vec{u}(\vec{x},t)$ and the fluid
density $\rho (\vec{x},t)$ itself. we derive the conditions for the
divergence-free fluid velocity vector field $\nabla \cdot \vec{u}=0$ in
scenarios when the fluid density is not constant $\rho(\vec{x},t)\neq const$
over space nor time, and we analyze scenarios of the non-zero divergence
$\nabla \cdot \vec{u}\ne 0$. we apply the statement for divergence in the
navier-stokes equation for compressible fluids, and we deduct the condition for
vanishing (zero) viscosity term of the compressible navier-stokes equation:
$\nabla (\frac{1}{\rho } (\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +\vec{u}\cdot
\nabla \rho ))=-3\delta \vec{u}$. in addition to that, we derive even more
elementary condition for vanishing viscosity, stating that vanishing viscosity
is triggered once scalar function $d(\vec{x},t)=-\frac{1}{\rho }
(\frac{\partial \rho }{\partial t} +\vec{u}\cdot \nabla \rho )$ is harmonic
function. once that condition is satisfied, the viscosity related term of the
navier-stokes equations for compressible fluids equals to zero, which is known
as related to turbulent fluid flows.

"in recent years, non-newtonian fluids have received much attention due to
their numerous applications, such as plastic manufacture and extrusion of
polymer fluids. they are more complex than newtonian fluids because the
relationship between shear stress and shear rate is nonlinear. one particular
subclass of non-newtonian fluids is the generalized oldroyd-b fluid, which is
modelled using terms involving multi-term time fractional diffusion and
reaction. in this paper, we consider the application of the finite difference
method for this class of novel multi-term time fractional viscoelastic
non-newtonian fluid models. an important contribution of the work is that the
new model not only has a multi-term time derivative, of which the fractional
order indices range from 0 to 2, but also possesses a special time fractional
operator on the spatial derivative that is challenging to approximate. there
appears to be no literature reported on the numerical solution of this type of
equation. we derive two new different finite difference schemes to approximate
the model. then we establish the stability and convergence analysis of these
schemes based on the discrete $h^1$ norm and prove that their accuracy is of
$o(\tau+h^2)$ and $o(\tau^{\min\{3-\gamma_s,2-\alpha_q,2-\beta\}}+h^2)$,
respectively. finally, we verify our methods using two numerical examples and
apply the schemes to simulate an unsteady magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) couette
flow of a generalized oldroyd-b fluid model. our methods are effective and can
be extended to solve other non-newtonian fluid models such as the generalized

"fluid-structure interaction (fsi) and wave propagation in engineering
structures can cause severe damage to piping systems or fluid machines,
inducing serious accidents. in these phenomena, the mechanism of structural
damage depends on the wave propagation across the fluid-solid interface.
previous studies reported that disagreements between the induced pressure value
on the solid-fluid movable interface and the value predicted by the classical
one-dimensional theory arose from the effects of two-dimensional wave
propagation. to address this problem, in this study, a two-dimensional
axisymmetric simulation of wave propagation across the solid-fluid interface
with fsi was conducted. the simulation was performed using ansys autodyn with a
lagrangian solver for solids and eulerian solver for water. the results showed
that radial wave propagation caused by the dynamic effect of the tube and
water's inertia affected the peak pressure on the solid-fluid interface. the
peak pressure was attenuated near the tube wall because of the inertial effect
of the tube and fluid expansion. by calculating the mean pressure and axial
stress to compare the simulated peak pressure with that from one-dimensional
acoustic theory, it was indicated that the transition region for transmitted
pressure was located immediately after the solid-fluid interface. in this
region, the transmitted peak pressure may exceed the value predicted by
one-dimensional acoustic theory. the transition region was oriented in the
axial direction from the interface. in addition, prediction of the transmitted
peak pressure with one-dimensional acoustic theory was suggested via normal
wave speed in the unconfined fluid from a safety engineering perspective,
although the circumferential stress generated in the tube enclosing fluid can
be sufficiently accurately predicted using the same theory with the korteweg
speed.

"this contribution briefly reviews some recent work demonstrating the partial
breakdown of the colloidal fluid <--> atomic fluid analogy. the success of
liquid state theory for atomic fluids stems in part from the van der waals
picture, where steric interactions dominate the structure, and attractive
interactions can be added as a perturbation. for complex fluids described by
effective potentials, this picture may break down. in the first example
discussed, depletion potentials in non-additive hard-sphere mixtures are shown
to be surprisingly complex, leading to fluid structure and fluid-solid
transitions dominated by properties of the attractive potentials instead of by
the hard-cores. many colloidal suspensions, and possibly globular proteins,
fall into this {\em energetic fluid} category. in the second example, the
coarse-graining of polymers leads to soft-core effective potentials and
associated {\em mean field fluid} behaviour distinguished by a breakdown of the
virial expansion, an equation of state that is nevertheless nearly linear in
density, and correlation functions well described by the random phase

"complex fluids, such as polymer solutions and blends, colloids and gels, are
of growing interest in fundamental and applied soft-condensed-matter science. a
common feature of all such systems is the presence of a mesoscopic structural
length scale intermediate between atomic and macroscopic scales. this
mesoscopic structure of complex fluids is often fragile and sensitive to
external perturbations. complex fluids are frequently viscoelastic (showing a
combination of viscous and elastic behaviour) with their dynamic response
depending on the time and length scales. recently, non-invasive methods to
infer the rheological response of complex fluids have gained popularity through
the technique of microrheology, where the diffusion of probe spheres in a
viscoelastic fluid is monitored with the aid of light scattering or microscopy.
here we propose an alternative to traditional microrheology that does not
require doping of probe particles in the fluid (which can sometimes drastically
alter the molecular environment). instead, our proposed method makes use of the
phenomenon of ""avoided crossing"" between modes associated with the structural
relaxation and critical fluctuations that are spontaneously generated in the
system.

"using density functional theory we calculate the density profiles of a binary
solvent adsorbed around a pair of big solute particles. all species interact
via repulsive gaussian potentials. the solvent exhibits fluid-fluid phase
separation and for thermodynamic states near to coexistence the big particles
can be surrounded by a thick adsorbed `wetting' film of the coexisting solvent
phase. on reducing the separation between the two big particles we find there
can be a `bridging' transition as the wetting films join to form a fluid
bridge. the potential between the two big particles becomes long ranged and
strongly attractive in the bridged configuration. within our mean-field
treatment the bridging transition results in a discontinuity in the solvent
mediated force. we demonstrate that accounting for the phenomenon of bridging
requires the presence of a non-zero bridge function in the correlations between
the solute particles when our model fluid is described within a full mixture

"the use of ultra-thin, i.e., monolayer films plays an important role for the
emerging field of nano-fluidics. since the dynamics of such films is governed
by the interplay between substrate-fluid and fluid-fluid interactions, the
transport of matter in nanoscale devices may be eventually efficiently
controlled by substrate engineering. for such films, the dynamics is expected
to be captured by two-dimensional lattice-gas models with interacting
particles. using a lattice gas model and the non-linear diffusion equation
derived from the microscopic dynamics in the continuum limit, we study two
problems of relevance in the context of nano-fluidics. the first one is the
case in which along the spreading direction of a monolayer a mesoscopic-sized
obstacle is present, with a particular focus on the relaxation of the fluid
density profile upon encountering and passing the obstacle. the second one is

"the dynamic behavior of the slip length in a fluid flow confined between
atomically smooth surfaces is investigated using molecular dynamics
simulations. at weak wall-fluid interactions, the slip length increases
nonlinearly with the shear rate provided that the liquid/solid interface forms
incommensurable structures. a gradual transition to the linear rate-dependence
is observed upon increasing the wall-fluid interaction. we found that the slip
length can be well described by a function of a single variable that in turn
depends on the in-plane structure factor, contact density and temperature of
the first fluid layer near the solid wall. extensive simulations show that this
formula is valid in a wide range of shear rates and wall-fluid interactions.

since it permits to identify the classical dynamical system which advances in
time the quantum fluid fields. this type of approach, however requires the
identification of additional fluid fields. these can be generally identified
with suitable directional fluid temperatures $t_{qm,i}$ (for $i=1,2,3$), to be
related to the expectation values of momentum fluctuations appearing in the
heisenberg inequalities. nevertheless the definition given previously for them

observations qualitatively we suggest that the onset of subcritical instability
is related to decline of viscosity of the fluid: friction between fluid layers
fails with the increase of the velocity gradient. to describe the declinie of
friction theoretically we relax the the assumption of the stability of the
fluid material and introduce a constant of fluid strength. particularly, we
enhance the navier-stokes model with a failure description by introducing the
fluid strength in the constitutive equation for the viscous stress. the
clasical model is obtained from the enhanced one when strength goes to
infinity. we use the modified navier-stokes model to analyze the couette flow
between two parallel plates and find that the lateral perturbations can
destabilize the flow and the critical reynolds number is proportional to the
fluid strength. the latter means that the classical navier-stokes model of a

prediction of the fluid velocity spatial autocorrelation function. even for
uncorrelated swimmers, the theory predicts anticorrelations between nearby
fluid elements that correspond to vortex-like swirling motions in the fluid
with length scale set by the size of a swimmer and the slit height. very
similar results arise from the full simulations indicating either that
correlated motion of the swimmers is not significant at the concentrations
considered or that the fluid phase autocorrelation is not a sensitive measure
of the correlated motion. this result is in stark contrast with results from
unconfined systems, for which the fluid autocorrelation captures large-scale

independent, but interacting fluids: dust and a diffusive cosmic ray gas,
described within the fluid approximation, with an option to add other fluids in
an easy way. the code has been equipped with shearing-box boundary conditions,
and a selfgravity module, ohmic resistivity module, as well as other facilities
which are useful in astrophysical fluid-dynamical simulations. the code is
parallelized by means of the mpi library. in this paper we introduce the

to the difference in azimuthal velocities of gas and dust and the drag force
acting on both components dust drifts towards maxima of gas pressure

have performed direct numerical simulations (dns) of two fluids (the normal
fluid and the superfluid) coupled by mutual friction. we have found evidence of
strong locking of superfluid and normal fluid along the turbulent cascade, from
the large scale structures where only one fluid is forced down to the vorticity
structures at small scales. we have determined the residual slip velocity
between the two fluids, and, for each fluid, the relative balance of inertial,
viscous and friction forces along the scales. our calculations show that the
classical relation between energy injection and dissipation scale is not valid
in quantum turbulence, but we have been able to derive a temperature--dependent
superfluid analogous relation. finally, we discuss our dns results in terms of

"phase-space lagrangian dynamics in ideal fluids (i.e, continua) is usually
related to the so-called {\it ideal tracer particles}. the latter, which can in

particles of infinitesimal size which do not produce significant perturbations
of the fluid and do not interact among themselves. an unsolved theoretical
problem is the correct definition of their dynamics in ideal fluids. the issue
is relevant in order to exhibit the connection between fluid dynamics and the
classical dynamical system, underlying a prescribed fluid system, which
uniquely generates its time-evolution. \

"chaotic motion in time of a number of macroscopic systems has been analyzed,
in the framework of scale relativity, as motion in a fractal space with
topological dimension 3 and geodesics with fractal dimension 2. the motion

gives the well-known euler and navier-stokes equations. we generalize here this
formalism to the study of a system exhibiting a chaotic behavior both in space

from the geodesic features of a fractal `space-time' with topological dimension
4 and geodesics with fractal dimension 2. this allows us to obtain both a

describing the complete crossover from the newtonian regime at low shear rate
to the strongly shear-thinning regime at high shear rate. the width selection
of a single steady-state finger is studied in detail for a 2-plateaux

"we develop a two dimensional, self-consistent, compressible fluid model to
study evolution of alfvenic modes in partially ionized astrophysical and space
plasmas. the partially ionized plasma consists mainly of electrons, ions and
significant neutral atoms. the nonlinear interactions amongst these species
take place predominantly through direct collision or charge exchange processes.
our model uniquely describe the interaction processes between two distinctly
evolving fluids. in our model, the electrons and ions are described by a single
fluid compressible magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) model and are coupled
self-consistently to the neutral fluid via compressible hydrodynamic equations.
both plasma and neutral fluids are treated with different energy equations that
adequately enable us to monitor non adiabatic and thermal energy exchange
processes between these two distinct fluids. based on our self-consistent
model, we find that the propagation speed of alfvenic modes in space and
astrophysical plasma is slowed down because these waves are damped
predominantly due to direct collisions with the neutral atoms. consequently,
energy transfer takes place between plasma and neutral fluids. we describe the
mode coupling processes that lead to the energy transfer between the plasma and
neutral and corresponding spectral features.

"many microorganisms swim through gels and non-newtonian fluids in their
natural environments. in this paper, we focus on microorganisms which use
flagella for propulsion. we address how swimming velocities are affected in
nonlinearly viscoelastic fluids by examining the problem of an infinitely long
cylinder with arbitrary beating motion in the oldroyd-b fluid. we solve for the
swimming velocity in the limit in which deflections of the cylinder from its
straight configuration are small relative to the radius of the cylinder and the
wavelength of the deflections; furthermore, the radius of the cylinder is small
compared to the wavelength of deflections. we find that swimming velocities are
diminished by nonlinear viscoelastic effects. we apply these results to examine
what types of swimming motions can produce net translation in a nonlinear
fluid, comparing to the newtonian case, for which purcell's ""scallop"" theorem
describes how time-reversibility constrains which swimming motions are
effective. we find that the leading order violation of the scallop theorem
occurs for reciprocal motions in which the backward and forward strokes occur
at different rates.

analytically fluid transport driven by a transverse, small amplitude traveling
wave propagation. the pumping flow far from the waving boundary is shown to be
strongly wave number and viscosity dependent, in contrast to a viscous

relevant to small wave numbers, the fluidic transport is almost the same as the
newtonian case, and uniform viscoelastic constitutive equations provide a good
approximation. in the other regime, the pumping is substantially decreased
because of the gel-like character. the boundary separating these two regimes is

"shear thickening is a phenomenon of significant viscosity increase of
colloidal suspensions. while electrorheological (er) fluids can be turned into
a solid-like material by applying an electric field, their shear strength is
widely represented by the attractive electrostatic interaction between er

reversible shear thickening of er fluids above a low critical shear rate (<1

characterized by a modified mason number. shear thickening and electrostatic
particle interaction-induced inter-particle friction forces is considered to be
the real origin of the high shear strength of er fluids, while the applied

"assume that a stochastic processes can be approximated, when some scale
parameter gets large, by a fluid limit (also called ""mean field limit"", or
""hydrodynamic limit""). a common practice, often called the ""fixed point
approximation"" consists in approximating the stationary behaviour of the
stochastic process by the stationary points of the fluid limit. it is known
that this may be incorrect in general, as the stationary behaviour of the fluid
limit may not be described by its stationary points. we show however that, if
the stochastic process is reversible, the fixed point approximation is indeed
valid. more precisely, we assume that the stochastic process converges to the
fluid limit in distribution (hence in probability) at every fixed point in
time. this assumption is very weak and holds for a large family of processes,
among which many mean field and other interaction models. we show that the
reversibility of the stochastic process implies that any limit point of its
stationary distribution is concentrated on stationary points of the fluid
limit. if the fluid limit has a unique stationary point, it is an approximation
of the stationary distribution of the stochastic process.

satisfied at the ideal fluid order. at the leading viscous order, the

"the purpose of the present work is to trace parallels between the known
inertia forces in fluid dynamics with the inertia forces in electromagnetism
that are known to induce resistance forces on masses both due to acceleration
and at constant velocity. it is shown that the force exerted on a particle by
an ideal fluid produces two effects: i) resistance to acceleration and, ii) an
increase of mass with velocity. these resistance forces arise due to the fluid
dragged by the particle, where the bare mass of the particle at rest changes
when in motion (""dressed"" particle). it is demonstrated that the vector
potential created by a charged particle in motion acts as an ideal space flow
that surrounds the particle. the interaction between the particle and the
entrained space flow gives rise to the observed properties of inertia and the
relativistic increase of mass. parallels are made between the inertia property
of matter, electromagnetism and the hydrodynamic drag in potential flow.
accordingly, in this framework the non resistance of a particle in uniform
motion through an ideal fluid (d'alembert's paradox) corresponds to newton's

system: paramagnetic particles submerged in water and activated by an
oscillating magnetic field. the magnetic field induces magnetic attractions
among the paramagnetic particles, activating the particles, and injecting
energy into the fluid. over many cycles, the particles aggregate together and
form clusters. in order to form clusters, however, the particles must overcome
viscous drag. we investigate the relative roles of viscosity and magnetism.
when the role of viscosity is important, the particles cannot form large

"we apply the geometric theory of swimming at low reynolds number to the study
of nearly circular swimmers in two-dimensional fluids with non-vanishing hall,

the fluid stress-tensor, which results in a number of striking effects. in
particular, we find that a swimmer whose area is changing will experience a
torque proportional to the rate of change of the area, with the constant of
proportionality given by the coefficient $\eta^o$ of odd viscosity. after
working out the general theory of swimming in fluids with hall viscosity for a
class of simple swimmers, we give a number of example swimming strokes which
clearly demonstrate the differences between swimming in a fluid with
conventional viscosity and a fluid which also has a hall viscosity. a number of

of fluid flows averaged over fast circulations in the inter-vortex space. the
hydrodynamics of the vortex fluid features the anomalous stress absent in
euler's hydrodynamics. the anomalous stress yields a number of interesting

using this general expression, we show that a quark that is instantaneously at
rest, relative to the fluid, in a fluid whose velocity is changing with time
feels a nonzero force. and, we show that for a quark that is moving
ultra-relativistically, the first order gradient ""corrections"" become larger
than the zeroth order drag force, suggesting that the gradient expansion may be
unreliable in this regime. we illustrate the importance of the fluid gradients

"we use confocal microscopy to directly visualize the formation and complex
morphologies of trapped non-wetting fluid ganglia within a model 3d porous

this flow is characterized by a capillary number, ca. we find that the ganglia
configurations do not vary for small ca; by contrast, as ca is increased above
a threshold value, the largest ganglia start to become mobilized and are
ultimately removed from the medium. by combining our 3d visualization with
measurements of the bulk transport, we show that this behavior can be
quantitatively understood by balancing the viscous forces exerted on the
ganglia with the pore-scale capillary forces that keep them trapped within the

"quasi-two-dimensional fluids can be generated by confining a fluid between
two parallel walls with narrow separation. such fluids exhibit an inhomogeneous

interaction between the entropy gradients and the fluid velocity gradients.
especially, in the multiple charged fluids, the vorticity and magnetic field

"we explore the structural properties of anomalous fluids confined in a
nanopore using molecular dynamics simulations. the fluid is modeled by
core-softened (cs) potentials that have a repulsive shoulder and an attractive
well at a further distance. changing the attractive well depth of the

are evaluated as a function of particle size, amphiphilicity, fluid density,
and interfacial tension. we show that as the particle amphiphilicity increases
due to enhanced wetting of each side with its favorite fluid, the rotational
thermal motion decreases. moreover, the in-plane diffusion of nanoparticles at
the interface becomes slower for more amphiphilic particles, mainly due to
formation of a denser adsorption layer. the particles induce an ordered
structure in the surrounding fluid that becomes more pronounced for highly
amphiphilic nanoparticles, leading to increased resistance against nanoparticle
motion. a similar phenomenon is observed for homogeneous particles diffusing in

"swimming cells often have to self-propel through fluids displaying
non-newtonian rheology. while past theoretical work seems to indicate that
stresses arising from complex fluids should systematically hinder low-reynolds
number locomotion, experimental observations suggest that locomotion
enhancement is possible. in this paper we propose a physical mechanism for
locomotion enhancement of microscopic swimmers in a complex fluid. it is based
on the fact that micro-structured fluids will generically phase-separate near
surfaces, leading to the presence of low-viscosity layers which promote slip
and decrease viscous friction near the surface of the swimmer. we use two
models to address the consequence of this phase separation: a nonzero apparent
slip length for the fluid and then an explicit modeling of the change of
viscosity in a thin layer near the swimmer. considering two canonical setups
for low-reynolds number locomotion, namely the waving locomotion of a
two-dimensional sheet and that of a three-dimensional filament, we show that
phase-separation systematically increases the locomotion speeds, possibly by
orders of magnitude. we close by confronting our predictions with recent

vertical vibrations of the base creates a fictitious force which opposes the

"the fluids and polymers have different fundamental symmetries. namely, the
lagrangian relabeling symmetry of fluids is absent for polymers (while the
translational and rotational symmetries are still present). this fact results
in spontaneous breaking of the relabeling symmetry in fluid turbulence even at
a tiny polymer addition. since helicity conservation in inviscid fluid motions
is a consequence of the relabeling symmetry (due to the noether's theorem)
violation of this conservation by the polymer additives results in the strong
effects in the distributed chaos. the distributed chaos in turbulence with the
spontaneously broken relabeling symmetry is characterized by stretched
exponential spectra $\propto \exp(-k/k_{\beta})^{\beta}$ with $\beta =2/5$. the
spectral range of this distributed chaos is extended in direction of the small

but this has not been approached for fluid-loaded structures that support
surface waves coupled with the acoustic field in a bulk fluid. this surface
wave, coupled with the fluid, can be used to create an additional effect by
designing a metasurface to mode convert from surface to bulk waves. we

"we derive macroscopic dynamics for self-propelled particles in a fluid. the
starting point is a coupled vicsek-stokes system. the vicsek model describes
self-propelled agents interacting through alignment. it provides a
phenomenological description of hydrodynamic interactions between agents at
high density. stokes equations describe a low reynolds number fluid. these two
dynamics are coupled by the interaction between the agents and the fluid. the
fluid contributes to rotating the particles through jeffery's equation.
particle self-propulsion induces a force dipole on the fluid. after
coarse-graining we obtain a coupled self-organised hydrodynamics (soh)-stokes
system. we perform a linear stability analysis for this system which shows that
both pullers and pushers have unstable modes. we conclude by providing

which concerns the motion of an oscillating boundary, our numerical analysis
predicts that a periodically rotating ring will oscillate at a higher frequency
in an active fluid than in a passive fluid, due to an activity-induced
reduction of the fluid inertia. in the case of a freely suspended
fluid-container system that is isolated from external forces or torques, active
fluid stresses can induce large fluctuations in the container's angular
momentum if the confinement radius matches certain multiples of the intrinsic
vortex size of the active suspension. this effect could be utilized to
transform collective microscopic swimmer activity into macroscopic motion in
optimally tuned geometries.

"effective methods of fluid transport vary across scale. a commonly used
dimensionless number for quantifying the effective scale of fluid transport is
the reynolds number, re, which gives the ratio of inertial to viscous forces.
what may work well for one re regime may not produce significant flows for
another. these differences in scale have implications for many organisms,
ranging from the mechanics of how organisms move through their fluid
environment to how hearts pump at various stages in development. some
organisms, such as soft pulsing corals, actively contract their tentacles to
generate mixing currents that enhance photosynthesis. their unique morphology
and intermediate scale where both viscous and inertial forces are significant
make them a unique model organism for understanding fluid mixing. in this
paper, 3d fluid-structure interaction simulations of a pulsing soft coral are
used to quantify fluid transport and fluid mixing across a wide range of re.
the results show that net transport is negligible for $re<10$, and continuous
upward flow is produced for $re\geq 10$.

"the radially outward flow of fluid through a porous medium occurs in many
practical problems, from transport across vascular walls to the pressurisation
of boreholes in the subsurface. when the driving pressure is non-negligible
relative to the stiffness of the solid structure, the poromechanical coupling
between the fluid and the solid can control both the steady-state and the
transient mechanics of the system. very large pressures or very soft materials
lead to large deformations of the solid skeleton, which introduce kinematic and
constitutive nonlinearity that can have a nontrivial impact on these mechanics.
here, we study the transient response of a poroelastic cylinder to sudden fluid
injection. we consider the impacts of kinematic and constitutive nonlinearity,
both separately and in combination, and we highlight the central role of
driving method in the evolution of the response. we show that the various
facets of nonlinearity may either accelerate or decelerate the transient
response relative to linear poroelasticity, depending on the boundary

exploiting an infinitesimal method in lagrangian coordinates, the idea of
(equivalent) magnetic tension, and the differential version of magnetic flux
conservation, we give an explanation of physical mechanism for the magnetic
inhibition phenomenon in a non-resistive mhd fluid. moreover, we find that the
magnetic energy in the non-resistive mhd fluid depends on the displacement of
fluid particles, and thus can be regarded as elastic potential energy.
motivated by this observation, we further use the well-known minimum potential
energy principle to explain the physical meaning of the stability/instability
criteria in the nmrt problem. as a result of the analysis, we further extend
the results on the nmrt problem to the stratified mhd fluid case. we point out
that our magnetic inhibition theory can be used to explain the inhibition

simple fluids can be approximated as a ratio of the squared thermal velocity of

not exact, this earlier suggestion nevertheless provides a very sensible way of
normalization of the self-diffusion constant. additionally, we demonstrate that
certain quantitative properties of self-diffusion in yukawa melts are also
shared by systems like one-component plasma and liquid metals at freezing,
providing support to an emerging dynamical freezing indicator for simple soft

higher settling efficiency for increasing $\phi$, similar to what is found in
shear-thinning fluids and opposite to what is found in newtonian fluids. the
critical yield number at which the suspension is held stationary in the carrier
fluid is found to increase monotonically with $\phi$, while the transition to

settle while more isolated particles remain arrested. in this regime, complex
flow features are observed in the sedimenting suspension, including the
mobilization of lone particles by nearby sedimentation clusters. understanding
this regime, and the transition to a fully arrested state, is relevant to many

miscalculation of viscosity corresponds with an overestimate of the power the

increasing porosity, depending on the aspect ratio $\alpha$ of the pores, fluid
to solid bulk modulus ratio $\zeta$, and initial poisson's ratio $\nu_0$ of the

separating cases where $v_\mathrm{p}/v_\mathrm{s}$ increases (if
$\nu_0<\nu_\mathrm{0,crit}$) or \emph{decreases} (if

reactivation depends on injection rate. the higher the injection rate, the
higher the peak fluid pressure allowing fault reactivation. elastic wave
velocity measurements along fault strike highlight that high injection rates
induce significant fluid pressure heterogeneities, which explains that the
onset of fault reactivation is not determined by a conventional coulomb law and

squirmers, it is found that swimming speed and feeding are most affected by a
non-uniform viscosity environment when the ratio of advection-forces to
diffusion-transport, characterized by the nondimensional pecl\'et number, is
moderate ($\text{pe}\approx 10$). these changes are correlated to significant
increases in the pressure force on the surface of the squirmer. the swimming

step of all fluids obtained according to cfl conditions to evolve the fluid
states, which limits the computational efficiency, as the sound speed c of one

original gfm-like sharp interface methods, the present method is developed by
solving the governing equations of each individual fluid with the corresponding
time step. without violating the numerical stability requirement, the states of

the interaction step between two fluids is solved for synchronization, which is
handled by interpolating the intermediate states of fluid with larger
time-scale features. in addition, an interfacial flux correction is implemented

"the document describes a numerical algorithm to simulate plasmas and fluids
in the 3 dimensional space by the euler method, in which the spatial meshes are
fixed to the space. the plasmas and fluids move through the spacial euler mesh
boundary. the euler method can represent a large deformation of the plasmas and
fluids. on the other hand, when the plasmas or fluids are compressed to a high
density, the spatial resolution should be ensured to describe the density
change precisely. the present 3d euler code is developed to simulate a nuclear
fusion fuel ignition and burning. therefore, the 3d euler code includes the dt
fuel reactions, the alpha particle diffusion, the alpha particle deposition to
heat the dt fuel and the dt fuel depletion by the dt reactions, as well as the
thermal energy diffusion based on the three-temperature compressible fluid

"heat exchangers are devices that typically transfer heat between two fluids.
the performance of a heat exchanger such as heat transfer rate and pressure
loss strongly depends on the flow regime in the heat transfer system. in this
paper, we present a density-based topology optimization method for a two-fluid
heat exchange system, which achieves a maximum heat transfer rate under fixed
pressure loss. we propose a representation model accounting for three states,
i.e., two fluids and a solid wall between the two fluids, by using a single
design variable field. the key aspect of the proposed model is that mixing of
the two fluids can be essentially prevented without any penalty scheme. this is
because the solid constantly exists between the two fluids due to the use of
the single design variable field. we demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed approach through three-dimensional numerical examples in which an
optimized design is compared with a simple reference design, and the effects of
design conditions (i.e., reynolds number, prandtl number, design domain size,
and flow arrangements) are investigated.

"fast and stable fluid simulations are an essential prerequisite for
applications ranging from computer aided aerodynamic design of automobiles or
airplanes to simulations of physical effects in cgi to research in meteorology.
recent differentiable fluid simulations allow gradient based methods to
optimize e.g. fluid control systems in an informed manner. solving the partial
differential equations governed by the dynamics of the underlying physical
systems, however, is a challenging task and current numerical approximation
schemes still come at high computational costs.
  in this work, we propose an unsupervised framework that allows powerful deep
neural networks to learn the dynamics of incompressible fluids end to end on a
grid-based representation. for this purpose, we introduce a loss function that
penalizes residuals of the incompressible navier stokes equations. after
training, the framework yields models that are capable of fast and
differentiable fluid simulations and can handle various fluid phenomena such as
the magnus effect and k\'arm\'an vortex streets. besides demonstrating its
real-time capability on a gpu, we exploit our approach in a control
optimization scenario.

"a two-fluid discrete boltzmann model(dbm) for compressible flows based on
ellipsoidal statistical bhatnagar-gross-krook(es-bgk) is presented. the model
has flexible prandtl number and specific heat ratio. mathematically, the model
is composed of two coupled discrete boltzmann equations(dbe). each dbe
describes one component of the fluid. physically, the model is equivalent to a
macroscopic fluid model based on navier-stokes(ns) equations, and supplemented
by a coarse-grained model for thermodynamic non-equilibrium behaviors. to
obtain a flexible prandtl number, a coefficient is introduced in the
ellipsoidal statistical distribution function to control the viscosity. to
obtain a flexible specific heat ratio, a parameter is introduced in the energy
kinetic moments to control the extra degree of freedom. for binary mixture, the
correspondence between the macroscopic fluid model and the dbm may be
several-to-one. five typical benchmark tests are used to verify and validate
the model. some interesting non-equilibrium results, which are not available in
the ns model or the single-fluid dbm, are presented.

"we revisit the issue of the fluid description of minimally coupled scalar
fields. while in a cosmological setup the interpretation of a time-evolving
scalar field as a perfect fluid is well-understood, the situation is more
intricate when the scalar field is static, but has a spatial gradient, a
situation motivated by black hole perturbations in scalar-tensor theories. then
the scalar field is interpreted as either a particular imperfect fluid of type
i or a superposition of a pair of leftgoing (incoming) and rightgoing
(outgoing) null dusts with a perfect fluid. finally, when the scalar gradient
is null, it is equivalent to an imperfect fluid of type ii, degenerating into
null dust when the energy conditions are imposed. we also propose the suitable
action in terms of the fluid pressure components for each case and discuss the
variational principle for a generic class of minimally coupled scalar fields.

"this paper presents a numerical method for the simulation of fluid-structure
interaction specifically tailored to interactions between newtonian fluids and
a large number of slender viscoelastic cosserat rods. because of their high
flexibility and low weight the rods considered here exhibit large deflections,
even under moderate fluid loads. their motion, in turn, modifies the flow so
that fluid and structures are strongly coupled to each other which is
numerically very challenging. the paper proposes a new coupling approach based
on an immersed boundary method which improves upon existing methods for this
problem. it is numerically stable and exempt from any global iteration between
the fluid part and the structure part, thus yielding high stability and low
computational cost of the coupling scheme. the contribution presents the
underlying methodology and its algorithmic realization, including an assessment
of accuracy and convergence by systematic studies. various validation cases
illustrate performance and versatility of the proposed method.

"we present results concerning the linear (radial and non-radial) oscillations
of non-rotating superfluid neutron stars in newtonian physics. we use a simple
two-fluid model to describe the superfluid neutron star, where one fluid
consists of the superfluid neutrons,while the second fluid contains all the
comoving constituents (protons, electrons). the two fluids are assumed to be
""free"" in the sense of absence of vortex-mediated forces like mutual friction
or pinning, but they can be coupled by the equation of state, in particular by
entrainment.we calculate numerically the eigen-frequencies and -modes of
adiabatic oscillations, neglecting beta-reactions that would lead to
dissipation.we find a doubling of all acoustic-type modes (f-modes, p-modes),
and confirm the absence of g-modes in these superfluid models. we show
analytically and numerically that only in the case of non-stratified background
models (i.e. with no composition gradient) can these doublets of acoustic modes
be separated into two distinct families, which are characterised by either co-
or counter-moving fluids respectively, and which are sometimes referred to as
""ordinary"" and ""superfluid"" modes. in the general, stratified case, however,
this separation is not possible, and these acoustic modes can not be classified
as being either purely ""ordinary"" or ""superfluid"". we show how the properties
of the two-fluid modes change as functions of the coupling by entrainment. we
find avoided mode-crossings for the stratified models, while the crossings are
not avoided in the non-stratified, separable case. the oscillations of
normal-fluid neutron stars are recovered as a special case simply by locking
the two fluids together.in this effective one-fluid case we find the usual

"we study the effect of fluids on the angle of repose and the segregation of
granular matter poured into a silo. the experiments are conducted in two
regimes where: (i) the volume fraction of the fluid is small and it forms
liquid bridges between particles, and (ii) the particles are completely
immersed in the fluid. the data is obtained by imaging the pile formed inside a
quasi-two dimensional silo through the transparent glass side walls. in the
first series of experiments, the angle of repose is observed to increase
sharply with the volume fraction of the fluid and then saturates at a value
that depends on the size of the particles. we systematically study the effect
of viscosity by using water-glycerol mixtures to vary it over at least three
orders of magnitude while keeping the surface tension almost constant. besides
surface tension, the viscosity of the fluid is observed to have an effect on
the angle of repose and the extent of segregation. in case of bidisperse
particles, segregation is observed to decrease and finally saturate depending
on the size ratio of the particles and the viscosity of the fluid. the sharp
initial change and the subsequent saturation in the extent of segregation and
angle of repose occurs over similar volume fraction of the fluid. in the second
series of experiments, particles are poured into a container filled with a
fluid. although the angle of repose is observed to be unchanged, segregation is
observed to decrease with an increase in the viscosity of the fluid.

"the integral equations for the correlation functions of an inhomogeneous
fluid mixture are derived using a functional taylor expansion of the free
energy around an inhomogeneous equilibrium distribution. the system of
equations is closed by the introduction of a reference functional for the
correlations beyond second order in the density difference from the equilibrium
distribution. explicit expressions are obtained for energies required to insert
particles of the fluid mixture into the inhomogeneous system. the approach is
illustrated by the determination of the equation of state of a simple,
truncated lennard--jones fluid and the analysis of the behavior of this fluid
near a hard wall. the wall--fluid integral equation exhibits complete drying
and the corresponding coexisting densities are in good agreement with those
obtained from the standard (maxwell) construction applied to the bulk fluid.
self--consistency of the approach is examined by analyzing the
virial/compressibility routes to the equation of state and the gibbs--duhem
relation for the bulk fluid, and the contact density sum rule and the gibbs
adsorption equation for the hard wall problem. for the bulk fluid, we find good
self--consistency for stable states outside the critical region. for the hard
wall problem, the gibbs adsorption equation is fulfilled very well near phase
coexistence where the adsorption is large.for the contact density sum rule, we
find some deviationsnear coexistence due to a slight disagreement between the
coexisting density for the gas phase obtained from the maxwell construction and
from complete drying at the hard wall.

"we have studied the flow induced by a macroscopic spherical particle settling
in a laponite suspension that exhibits a yield-stress, thixotropy and
shear-thinning. we show that the fluid thixotropy (or aging) induces an
increase with time of both the apparent yield stress and shear-thinning
properties but also a breaking of the flow fore-aft symmetry predicted in
hershel-bulkley fluids (yield-stress, shear-thinning fluids with no
thixotropy). we have also varied the stress exerted by the particles on the
fluid by using particles of different densities. although the stresses exerted
by the particles are of the same order of magnitude, the velocity field
presents utterly different features: whereas the flow around the lighter
particle shows a confinement similar to the one observed in shear-thinning
fluids, the wake of the heavier particle is characterized by an upward motion
of the fluid (""negative wake""), whatever the fluid's age. we compare the
features of this negative wake to the one observed in viscoelastic
shear-thinning fluids (polymeric or micelle solutions). although the flows
around the two particles strongly differ, their settling behaviors display no
apparent difference which constitutes an intriguing result and evidences the
complexity of the dependence of the drag factor on flow field.

theory of dissipative relativistic fluid, are solved simultaneously with the
energy-momentum conservation equations. comparison of evolution of ideal and

"it is well-known that in fluid dynamics an alternative to customary direct
solution methods (based on the discretization of the fluid fields) is provided
by so-called \emph{particle simulation methods}. particle simulation methods
rely typically on appropriate \emph{kinetic models} for the fluid equations
which permit the evaluation of the fluid fields in terms of suitable
expectation values (or \emph{momenta}) of the kinetic distribution function
$f(\mathbf{r,v},t),$ being respectively $\mathbf{r}$ and\textbf{\}$\mathbf{v}$
the position an velocity of a test particle with probability density
$f(\mathbf{r,v},t)$. these kinetic models can be continuous or discrete in
phase space, yielding respectively \emph{continuous} or \emph{discrete kinetic
models} for the fluids. however, also particle simulation methods may be biased
by an undesirable computational complexity. in particular, a fundamental issue
is to estimate the algorithmic complexity of numerical simulations based on
traditional lbm's (lattice-boltzmann methods; for review see succi, 2001
\cite{succi}). these methods, based on a discrete kinetic approach, represent
currently an interesting alternative to direct solution methods. here we intend
to prove that for incompressible fluids fluids lbm's may present a high
complexity. the goal of the investigation is to present a detailed account of
the origin of the various complexity sources appearing in customary lbm's. the
result is relevant to establish possible strategies for improving the numerical

between area minimization of the fluid vs. area maximization of the black hole

and surface gravity of the black hole. we also argue that the rayleigh-plateau

instability of a black string. associated with this fluid instability there is
a rich variety of phases of fluid solutions that we study in detail, including
in particular the effects of rotation. we compare them against the known
results for asymptotically flat black holes finding remarkable agreement.
furthermore, we use our fluid results to discuss the unknown features of the

simplified in the regime where this coupling becomes increasingly strong. many
descriptions in fluid mechanics and in the formulation of computational methods
account for fluid-structure interactions through viscous drag terms to transfer
momentum from the fluid to immersed structures. in the inertial regime, this
coupling often introduces a prohibitively small time-scale into the temporal
dynamics of the fluid-structure system. this is further exacerbated in the
presence of thermal fluctuations. we discuss here a systematic reduction
technique for the full inertial equations to obtain a simplified description
where this coupling term is eliminated. this approach also accounts for the

"we present two numerical schemes for passive tracer particles in the

various problems, from simple setups to cosmological simulations. the purpose
of tracer particles is to allow the flow to be followed in a lagrangian way,
tracing the evolution of the fluid with time, and allowing the thermodynamical
history of individual fluid parcels to be recorded. we find that the
commonly-used `velocity field tracers', which are advected using the fluid
velocity field, do not in general follow the mass flow correctly, and explain
why this is the case. this method can result in orders-of-magnitude biases in
simulations of driven turbulence and in cosmological simulations, rendering the
velocity field tracers inappropriate for following these flows. we then discuss
a novel implementation of `monte carlo tracers', which are moved along with
fluid cells, and are exchanged probabilistically between them following the
mass flux. this method reproduces the mass distribution of the fluid correctly.
the main limitation of this approach is that it is more diffusive than the
fluid itself. nonetheless, we show that this novel approach is more reliable
than what has been employed previously and demonstrate that it is appropriate
for following hydrodynamical flows in mesh-based codes. the monte carlo tracers
can also naturally be transferred between fluid cells and other types of

problem in which the structure is composed of two layers: a thin layer which is
in contact with the fluid, and a thick layer which sits on top of the thin
structural layer. the fluid flow, which is driven by the time-dependent dynamic
pressure data, is governed by the 2d navier-stokes equations for an
incompressible, viscous fluid, defined on a 2d cylinder. the elastodynamics of
the cylinder wall is governed by the 1d linear wave equation modeling the thin
structural layer, and by the 2d equations of linear elasticity modeling the
thick structural layer. the fluid and the structure, as well as the two
structural layers, are fully coupled via the kinematic and dynamic coupling
conditions describing continuity of velocity and balance of contact forces. the
thin structural layer acts as a fluid-structure interface with mass. the
resulting fsi problem is a nonlinear moving boundary problem of
parabolic-hyperbolic type. this problem is motivated by the flow of blood in

"in this work, the local pressure of fluids confined inside nanoslit pores is
predicted within the framework of the density functional theory. the
euler-lagrange equation in the density functional theory of statistical
mechanics is used to obtain the force balance equation which leads to a general
equation to predict the local normal component of the pressure tensor. our
approach yields a general equation for predicting the normal pressure of
confined fluids and it satisfies the exact bulk thermodynamics equation when
the pore width approaches infinity. as two basic examples, we report the

pore width, bulk density and temperature on the behavior of normal pressure are

the confined fluids normal pressure has an oscillatory behavior and the number
of oscillations increases with bulk density and temperature. the oscillations
also become broad and smooth with pore width at a constant temperature and bulk
density. in comparison with the hs confined fluid, the values of normal

"in a companion paper we have shown how the equations describing gas and dust
as two fluids coupled by a drag term can be reformulated to describe the system
as a single fluid mixture. here we present a numerical implementation of the
one-fluid dusty gas algorithm using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (sph). the
algorithm preserves the conservation properties of the sph formalism. in
particular, the total gas and dust mass, momentum, angular momentum and energy
are all exactly conserved. shock viscosity and conductivity terms are
generalised to handle the two-phase mixture accordingly. the algorithm is
benchmarked against a comprehensive suit of problems: dustybox, dustywave,
dustyshock and dustyoscill, each of them addressing different properties of the
method. we compare the performance of the one-fluid algorithm to the standard
two-fluid approach. the one-fluid algorithm is found to solve both of the
fundamental limitations of the two- fluid algorithm: it is no longer possible
to concentrate dust below the resolution of the gas (they have the same
resolution by definition), and the spatial resolution criterion h < csts,
required in two-fluid codes to avoid over-damping of kinetic energy, is
unnecessary. implicit time stepping is straightforward. as a result, the
algorithm is up to ten billion times more efficient for 3d simulations of small
grains. additional benefits include the use of half as many particles, a single
kernel and fewer sph interpolations. the only limitation is that it does not
capture multi-streaming of dust in the limit of zero coupling, suggesting that
in this case a hybrid approach may be required.

"supercritical fluids near the critical point are characterized by liquid-like
densities and gas-like transport properties. these features are purposely
exploited in different contexts ranging from natural products
extraction/fractionation to aerospace propulsion. large part of studies
concerns this last context, focusing on the dynamics of supercritical fluids at
high mach number where compressibility and thermodynamics strictly interact.
despite the widespread use also at low mach number, the turbulent mixing
properties of slightly supercritical fluids have still not investigated in
detail in this regime. this topic is addressed here by dealing with direct
numerical simulations (dns) of a coaxial jet of a slightly supercritical van
der waals fluid. since acoustic effects are irrelevant in the low mach number
conditions found in many industrial applications, the numerical model is based
on a suitable low-mach number expansion of the governing equation. according to
experimental observations, the weakly supercritical regime is characterized by
the formation of finger-like structures-- the so-called ligaments --in the
shear layers separating the two streams. the mechanism of ligament formation at
vanishing mach number is extracted from the simulations and a detailed
statistical characterization is provided. ligaments always form whenever a high
density contrast occurs, independently of real or perfect gas behaviors. the
difference between real and perfect gas conditions is found in the ligament
small-scale structure. more intense density gradients and thinner interfaces
characterize the near critical fluid in comparison with the smoother behavior
of the perfect gas. a phenomenological interpretation is here provided on the
basis of the real gas thermodynamics properties.

anisotropic contents, in contrast to isotropic mr fluid. the onset strains for
lvr to non-linear region transition for anisotropic fluids were much lower than
that of isotropic spherical nanoparticle-containing fluid. the stronger mr

"we explore a fluid description of the inflationary universe. in particular,
we investigate a fluid model in which the equation of state (eos) for a fluid
includes bulk viscosity. we find that the three observables of inflationary
cosmology: the spectral index of the curvature perturbations, the
tensor-to-scalar ratio of the density perturbations, and the running of the
spectral index, can be consistent with the recent planck results. we also
reconstruct the explicit eos for a fluid from the spectral index of the
curvature perturbations compatible with the planck analysis. in the
reconstructed models of a fluid, the tensor-to-scalar ratio of the density
perturbations can satisfy the constraints obtained from the planck satellite.
the running of the spectral index can explain the planck data. in addition, it
is demonstrated that in the reconstructed models of a fluid, the graceful exit
from inflation can be realized. moreover, we show that the singular inflation
can occur in a fluid model. furthermore, we show that a fluid description of
inflation can be equivalent to the description of inflation in terms of scalar
field theories.

"in this article we present a numerical method for simulating the
sedimentation of circular particles in two-dimensional channel filled with a
viscoelastic fluid of fene-cr type, which is generalized from a
domain/distributed lagrange multiplier method with a factorization approach for
oldroyd-b fluids developed in [j. non-newtonian fluid mech. 156 (2009) 95].
numerical results suggest that the polymer extension limit l for the fene-cr
fluid has no effect on the final formation of vertical chain for the cases of
two disks and three disks in two-dimensional narrow channel, at least for the
values of l considered in this article; but the intermediate dynamics of
particle interaction before having a vertical chain can be different for the
smaller values of l when increasing the relaxation time. for the cases of six
particles sedimenting in fene-cr type viscoelastic fluid, the formation of
chain of 4 to 6 disks does depend on the polymer extension limit l. for the
smaller values of l, fene-cr type viscoelastic fluid can not bring them
together like the case of these particles settling in a vertical chain
formation in oldroyd-b fluid; but two separated chains of three disks are
formed. similar results for the case of ten disks are also obtained. the
numerical results of several more particle cases suggest that for smaller
values of l, the length of the vertical chain is shorter and the size of
cluster is smaller.

"the study of nonmodal amplification of distributed body forces in channel
flows of viscoelastic fluids has provided useful insights into the mechanisms
that may govern the initial stages of transition to elastic turbulence.
however, distributed body forces are not easy to implement in experiments and
so there is a need to examine amplification of localized body forces. in this
work, we use the linearized governing equations to examine such amplification
in poiseuille flow of fene-cr fluids. we first identify the wall-normal
location at which the impulsive excitations experience the largest
amplification and then analyze the kinetic energy of the fluctuations and the
resulting flow structures. for both a newtonian fluid at high reynolds numbers
and a viscoelastic fluid at low reynolds numbers, the largest amplification
occurs for disturbances that are located near the channel wall. our analysis of
the energy evolution shows that a localized body force in the spanwise
direction has the largest impact and that the streamwise velocity component is
most affected. for viscoelastic fluids we observe the development of vortical
structures away from the source of impulsive excitation. this feature is less
prominent in newtonian fluids and it may provide a mechanism for triggering the
initial stages of transition to elastic turbulence.

"hydrodynamic instabilities in miscible fluids are ubiquitous, from natural
phenomena up to geological scales, to industrial and technological
applications, where they represent the only way to control and promote mixing
at low reynolds numbers, well below the transition from laminar to turbulent
flow. as for immiscible fluids, the onset of hydrodynamic instabilities in
miscible fluids is directly related to the physics of their interfaces. the
focus of this review is therefore on the general mechanisms driving the growth
of disturbances at the boundary between miscible fluids, under a variety of
forcing conditions. in the absence of a regularizing mechanism, these
disturbances would grow indefinitely. for immiscible fluids, interfacial
tension provides such a regularizing mechanism, because of the energy cost
associated to the creation of new interface by a growing disturbance. for
miscible fluids, however, the very existence of interfacial stresses that mimic
an effective surface tension is debated. other mechanisms, however, may also be
relevant, such as viscous dissipation. we shall review the stabilizing
mechanisms that control the most common hydrodynamic instabilities,
highlighting those cases for which the lack of an effective interfacial tension
poses deep conceptual problems in the mathematical formulation of a linear
stability analysis. finally, we provide a short overview on the ongoing
research on the effective, out of equilibrium interfacial tension between
miscible fluids.

"the influence of a fluid-fluid interface on self-phoresis of chemically
active, axially symmetric, spherical colloids is analyzed. distinct from the
studies of self-phoresis for colloids trapped at fluid interfaces or in the
vicinity of hard walls, here we focus on the issue of self-phoresis close to a
fluid-fluid interface. in order to provide physically intuitive results
highlighting the role played by the interface, the analysis is carried out for
the case that the symmetry axis of the colloid is normal to the interface;
moreover, thermal fluctuations are not taken into account. similarly to what
has been observed near hard walls, we find that such colloids can be set into
motion even if their whole surface is homogeneously active. this is due to the
anisotropy along the direction normal to the interface owing to the
partitioning by diffusion, among the coexisting fluid phases, of the product of
the chemical reaction taking place at the colloid surface. different from
results corresponding to hard walls, in the case of a fluid interface the
direction of motion, i.e., towards the interface or away from it, can be
controlled by tuning the physical properties of one of the two fluid phases.
this effect is analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, both by resorting to
a far-field approximation and via an exact, analytical calculation which
provides the means for a critical assessment of the approximate analysis.

"in this paper, we develop a novel phase-field model for fluid-structure
interaction (fsi), that is capable to handle very large deformations as well as
topology changes like contact of the solid to the domain boundary. the model is
based on a fully eulerian description of the velocity field in both, the fluid
and the elastic domain. viscous and elastic stresses in the navier-stokes
equations are restricted to the corresponding domains by multiplication with
their characteristic functions. to obtain the elastic stress, an additional
oldroyd-b - like equation is solved. thermodynamically consistent forces are
derived by energy variation. the convergence of the derived equations to the
traditional sharp interface formulation of fluid-structure interaction is shown
by matched asymptotic analysis. the model is evaluated in a challenging
benchmark scenario of an elastic body traversing a fluid channel. a comparison
to reference values from arbitrary lagrangian eulerian (ale) simulations shows
very good agreement. we highlight some distinct advantages of the new model,
like the avoidance of re-triangulations and the stable inclusion of surface
tension. further, we demonstrate how simple it is to include contact dynamics
into the model, by simulating a ball bouncing off a wall. we extend this
scenario to include adhesion of the ball, which to our knowledge, cannot be
simulated with any other fsi model. while we have restricted simulations to
fluid-structure interaction, the model is capable to simulate any combination
of viscous fluids, visco-elastic fluids and elastic solids.

"recently, many interesting features of the hydrodynamically coupled motions
of the brownian particles in a viscous fluid have been reported which are
impossible for the uncoupled motions of the similar particles. however, it is
expected that those physics in a viscoelastic fluid is much more interesting
due to the presence of the additional frequency dependent elasticity of the
medium. thus, a theory describing the equilibrium dynamics of two
hydrodynamically coupled brownian harmonic oscillators in a viscoelastic
maxwell fluid has been derived which appears with new and impressive aspects.
initially, the response functions have been calculated and then the
fluctuation-dissipation theorem has been used to calculate the correlation
functions between the coloured noises present on the concerned particles placed
in a maxwell fluid due to the thermal motions of the fluid molecules. these
correlation functions appear to be in a linear relationship with the
delta-correlated noises in a viscous fluid. consequently, this reduces the
statistical description of a simple viscoelastic fluid to the statistical
representation for an extended dynamical system subjected to delta-correlated
random forces. thereupon, the auto and cross-correlation functions in the time
domain and frequency domain and the mean-square displacement functions of the
particles have been calculated which are perfectly consistent with their
corresponding established forms in a viscous fluid and emerge with exceptional
characteristics.

"a vector calculus approach for the determination of advected invariants is
presented for inviscid fluid flow. this approach describes invariants by means
of lie dragging of scalars, vectors, and skew-tensors with respect to the fluid
velocity, which has the physical meaning of characterizing tensorial quantities
that are frozen into the flow. several new main results are obtained. first,
simple algebraic and differential operators that can be applied recursively to
derive a complete set of invariants starting from the basic known local and
nonlocal invariants are constructed. second, these operators are used to derive
infinite hierarchies of local and nonlocal invariants for both adiabatic fluids
and isentropic fluids that are either incompressible, or compressible with
barotropic and non-barotropic equations of state. each hierarchy is complete in
the sense that no further invariants can be generated from the basic local and
nonlocal invariants. all of the resulting new invariants are related to ertel's
invariant, the ertel-rossby invariant, and hollmann's invariant. in particular,
for incompressible fluid flow in which the density is non-constant across
different fluid streamlines, a new variant of ertel's invariant and several new
variants of hollmann's invariant are derived, where the entropy gradient is
replaced by the density gradient. third, the physical meaning of these new
invariants and the resulting conserved integrals are discussed, and their
relationship to conserved helicities and cross-helicities is described.

"incorporation of kinetic effects such as landau damping into a fluid
framework was pioneered by hammett and perkins prl 1990, by obtaining closures
of the fluid hierarchy, where the gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations or the
deviation of the 4th-order gyrotropic fluid moment, are expressed through
lower-order fluid moments. to obtain a closure of a fluid model expanded around
a bi-maxwellian distribution function, the usual plasma dispersion function
$z(\zeta)$ that appears in kinetic theory or the associated plasma response
function $r(\zeta)=1 + \zeta z(\zeta)$, have to be approximated with a suitable
pad\'e approximant in such a way, that the closure is valid for all $\zeta$
values. such closures are rare, and the original closures of hammett and
perkins are often employed. here we present a complete mapping of all plausible
landau fluid closures that can be constructed at the level of 4th-order moments
in the gyrotropic limit and we identify the most precise closures. furthermore,
by considering 1d closures at higher-order moments, we show that it is possible
to reproduce linear landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired
precision, thus showing convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic
descriptions.

"fluid deformable surfaces are ubiquitous in cell and tissue biology,
including lipid bilayers, the actomyosin cortex, or epithelial cell sheets.
these interfaces exhibit a complex interplay between elasticity, low reynolds
number interfacial hydrodynamics, chemistry, and geometry, and govern important
biological processes such as cellular traffic, division, migration, or tissue
morphogenesis. to address the modelling challenges posed by this class of
problems, in which interfacial phenomena tightly interact with the shape and
dynamics of the surface, we develop a general continuum mechanics and
computational framework for fluid deformable surfaces. the dual solid-fluid
nature of fluid deformable surfaces challenges classical lagrangian or eulerian
descriptions of deforming bodies. here, we extend the notion of arbitrarily
lagrangian-eulerian (ale) formulations, well-established for bulk media, to
deforming surfaces. to systematically develop models for fluid deformable
surfaces, which consistently treat all couplings between fields and geometry,
we follow a nonlinear onsager formalism according to which the dynamics
minimize a rayleighian functional where dissipation, power input and energy
release rate compete. finally, we propose new computational methods, which
build on onsager's formalism and our ale formulation, to deal with the
resulting stiff system of higher-order of partial differential equations. we
apply our theoretical and computational methodology to classical models for
lipid bilayers and the cell cortex. the methods developed here allow us to

"we describe the dynamics of two-dimensional relativistic and carrollian
fluids. these are mapped holographically to three-dimensional locally anti-de
sitter and locally minkowski spacetimes, respectively. to this end, we use
eddington-finkelstein coordinates, and grant general curved two-dimensional
geometries as hosts for hydrodynamics. this requires to handle the conformal
anomaly, and the expressions obtained for the reconstructed bulk metrics
incorporate non-conformal-fluid data. we also analyze the freedom of choosing
arbitrarily the hydrodynamic frame for the description of relativistic fluids,
and propose an invariant entropy current compatible with classical and extended
irreversible thermodynamics. this local freedom breaks down in the dual
gravitational picture, and fluid/gravity correspondence turns out to be
sensitive to dissipation processes: the fluid heat current is a necessary
ingredient for reconstructing all banados asymptotically anti-de sitter
solutions. the same feature emerges for carrollian fluids, which enjoy a

"direct numerical simulations of two superposed fluids in a channel with a
textured surface on the lower wall have been carried out. a parametric study
varying the viscosity ratio between the two fluids has been performed to mimic
both {\bf idealised} super hydrophobic and liquid infused surfaces and assess
its effect on the frictional, form and total drag for three different textured
geometries: longitudinal square bars, transversal square bars and staggered
cubes. the interface between the two fluids is assumed to be slippery in the
streamwise and spanwise directions and not deformable in the vertical
direction, corresponding to the ideal case of infinite surface tension. to
identify the role of the fluid-fluid interface, an extra set of simulations
with a single fluid has been carried out and compared to the results obtained
with two fluids of same viscosity separated by the interface. the drag and the
maximum wall-normal velocity fluctuations were found to be highly correlated
for all the surface configurations, whether they reduce or increase the drag.

"we introduce fluctuating hydrodynamics approaches on surfaces for capturing
the drift-diffusion dynamics of particles and microstructures immersed within
curved fluid interfaces of spherical shape. we take into account the
interfacial hydrodynamic coupling, traction coupling with the surrounding bulk

immersed boundary methods (ibm) and related stochastic eulerian-lagrangian

velocity autocorrelations, we find characteristic power-law scalings
$\tau^{-1}$, $\tau^{-2}$, and plateaus can emerge depending on the physical
regime associated with the geometry, surface viscosity, and bulk viscosity.
this differs from the characteristic $\tau^{-3/2}$ scaling for bulk three
dimensional fluids. we develop a theory explaining these observed power-laws
that can be interpreted using time-scales associated with dissipation within
the fluid interface and coupling to the bulk fluid. we then use our introduced

"fluid in interstitial spaces accounts for ~20% of an adult body weight. does
it circulate around the body like vascular circulations besides a diffusive and

conventional physiological concept, interstitial space was the space between
cells and a micron-sized space. fluid in interstitial spaces is thought to be
entrapped within interstitial matrix. however, our serial data have further
defined an interfacial transport zone on a solid fiber of interstitial matrix.
within this fine space that is probably nanosized, fluid can transport along a
fiber under a driving power. since 2006, our imaging data from volunteers and
cadavers have revealed a long-distance extravascular pathway for interstitial
fluid flow, comprising four types of anatomic distributions at least. the
framework of each extravascular pathway contains the longitudinally assembled
and oriented fibers, working as a fibrous guiderail for fluid flow.
interestingly, our data showed that the movement of fluid in a fibrous pathway
is in response to a dynamic driving source and named as dynamotaxis. by
analysis of some representative studies and our experimental results, a
hypothesis of interstitial fluid circulatory system is proposed.

"this work addresses the conjugate heat transfer of a simplified ptt fluid
flowing past an unbounded sphere in the stokes regime ($re = 0.01$). the
problem is numerically solved with the finite-volume method assuming axial
symmetry, absence of natural convection and constant physical properties. the
sphere generates heat at a constant and uniform rate, and the analysis is
conducted for a range of deborah ($0 \leq de \leq 100$), prandtl ($10^0 \leq pr
\leq 10^5$), brinkman ($0 \leq br \leq 100$) and conductivity ratios ($0.1 \leq
\kappa \leq 10$), in the presence or absence of thermal contact resistance at
the solid-fluid interface. the drag coefficient shows a monotonic decrease with
$de$, whereas the stresses on the sphere surface and in the wake first increase
and then decrease with $de$. a negative wake was observed for the two solvent
viscosity ratios tested ($\beta$ = 0.1 and 0.5), being more intense for the
more elastic fluid. in the absence of viscous dissipation, the average nusselt
number starts to decrease with $de$ after an initial increase. heat transfer
enhancement relative to an equivalent newtonian fluid was observed for the
whole range of conditions tested. the temperature of the sphere decreases and
becomes more homogeneous when its thermal conductivity increases in relation to
the conductivity of the fluid, although small changes are observed in the
nusselt number. the thermal contact resistance at the interface increases the
average temperature of the sphere, without affecting significantly the shape of
the temperature profiles inside the sphere. when viscous dissipation is
considered, significant changes are observed in the heat transfer process as
$br$ increases. overall, a simplified ptt fluid can enhance heat transfer
compared to a newtonian fluid, but increasing $de$ does not necessarily improve
heat exchange.

"in this work the numerical stability of a streamline singular
hyperbolic/saddle critical point (hsp) and its relationship with the divergence
of pressure force/fluid flux are numerically investigated at low reynolds
numbers. three canonical configurations at different reynolds numbers are
considered: (a) an isolated circular cylinder; (b) side-by-side circular
cylinders and (c) a near-wall circular cylinder. the objective is to
investigate the behavior of a hsp subjecting to imbalanced shear-layer
interaction and different reynolds numbers. it is found that a hsp evolves
along the shear-layer interfaces and imposes adverse pressure gradients, which
potentially deteriorates near-wake stability. the inherent characteristics of a
hsp is linked with net positive fluid-fluid divergence and fluid three
dimensionality. a vorticity-free stagnant zone is formed around a hsp, which
cut the kinetic energy supply of shear layers in wake, project
third-dimensional fluid fluxes and develops three-dimensional streamwise
braids. these findings are confirmed and explained via the quantification of
the fluid-flux divergence, the hydrodynamic responses of cylinder(s) and the
secondary enstrophy. the primary focus in this article is to reveal the subtle
analytical relationships between hsp, divergence of pressure force/fluid flux,

extend the idea of coupled quintessence mimicking the cosmological constant
with an uncoupled fluid, by including a disformal coupling, and (ii) to bring
these conformal and disformal couplings with a lcdm background, to a dynamical

both fluids are mimicking exactly a lcdm background. scenario ii consists of a
relativistic fluid, which is coupled to quintessence and both fluids are also
mimicking exactly the lcdm background. scenario iii consists of a relativistic
fluid (e.g. neutrinos), which is coupled to quintessence and both fluids are
mimicking a background with a cosmological constant and uncoupled radiation.

"in this contribution, the capabilities of the turbulence-resolving
eulerian-eulerian two-phase flow model to predict the suspension of
mono-dispersed finite-sized solid particles in a boundary layer flow is
investigated. for neutrally buoyant particles the two-fluid model having a
standard non-linear drag law accurately predicts the average concentration
profile. however, for heavier-than-fluid particles, having settling velocity on
the order of the bed friction velocity, the two-fluid model significantly
under-estimates the turbulent dispersion of particles. in this contribution, it
is hypothesized that finite-size effects are important in this case and a
correction model for the drag law is proposed to validate this hypothesis. this
model is based on the assumption that the turbulent flow scales larger than the
particle diameter will contribute to the resolved relative velocity between the
two phases whereas eddies smaller than the particle diameter will have two
effects (i) they will reduce the particle response time by adding a
sub-particle scale eddy viscosity to the drag coefficient and (ii) they will
contribute to increase the production of granular temperature. integrating
finite-size effects allows to quantitatively predict concentration profile for
heavier-than-fluid particles without altering the very good prediction of the
original two-fluid model for neutrally buoyant particles. the proposed
modification of the two-fluid model extends its range of applicability to
tackle heavier-than-fluid particles having a size belonging to the inertial
range of turbulence and allows to envision more complex applications in terms
of flow forcing conditions i.e. sheet-flow, wave-driven transport, turbidity

equilibration time, energy density and velocity profile, reveal that the
dissipative fluid evolves slowly, cooling at a slower rate. cooling get still
slower for higher viscosity. the fluid velocities on the otherhand evolve
faster in a dissipative fluid than in an ideal fluid. the transverse expansion
is also enhanced in dissipative evolution. for the same decoupling temperature,
freeze-out surface for a dissipative fluid is more extended than an ideal
fluid. dissipation produces entropy as a result of which particle production is
increased. particle production is increased due to (i) extension of the
freeze-out surface and (ii) change of the equilibrium distribution function to
a non-equilibrium one, the last effect being prominent at large transverse
momentum. compared to ideal fluid, transverse momentum distribution of pion
production is considerably enhanced. enhancement is more at high $p_t$ than at
low $p_t$. pion production also increases with viscosity, larger the viscosity,
more is the pion production. dissipation also modifies the elliptic flow.
elliptic flow is reduced in viscous dynamics. also, contrary to ideal dynamics
where elliptic flow continues to increase with transverse momentum, in viscous
dynamics, elliptic flow tends to saturate at large transverse momentum. the
analysis suggest that initial conditions of the hot, dense matter produced in
au+au collisions at rhic, as extracted from ideal fluid analysis can be changed
significantly if the qgp fluid is viscous.

the prediction of turbulence and transport in magnetized plasma come mainly
from the use of very cpu-consuming particle-in-cell or (gyro)kinetic codes
which naturally include non-maxwellian kinetic effects. to date, fluid codes
are not considered to be relevant for the description of these kinetic effects.
here, after revisiting the limitations of the current fluid theory developed in
the 19th century, we generalize the fluid theory including kinetic effects such
as non-maxwellian super-thermal tails with as few fluid equations as possible.
the collisionless and collisional fluid closures from the nonlinear landau
fokker-planck collision operator are shown for an arbitrary collisionality.
indeed, the first fluid models associated with two examples of collisionless
fluid closures are obtained by assuming an analytic non-maxwellian distribution
function (e.g., the inmdf [o. izacard, phys. plasmas 23, 082504 (2016)]). one
of the main differences with the literature is our analytic representation of
the distribution function in the velocity phase space with as few hidden
variables as possible thanks to the use of non-orthogonal basis sets. these new
non-maxwellian fluid equations could initiate the next generation of fluid
codes including kinetic effects and can be expanded to other scientific
disciplines such as astrophysics, condensed matter, or hydrodynamics. as a
validation test, we perform a numerical simulation based on a minimal reduced
inmdf fluid model. the result of this test is the discovery of the origin of
particle and heat diffusion. the diffusion is due to the competition between a
growing inmdf on short time scales due to spatial gradients and the
thermalization on longer time scales. the results shown here could draw the
breaking of some unsolved understandings of the turbulence.

moving through an elongated dilute gaseous bose-einstein condensate. the
barrier is created by a laser beam swept through the condensate, and the
resulting dipole potential can be either attractive or repulsive. we examine
both cases and find regimes of stable and unstable fluid flow: at slow speeds
of the barrier, the fluid flow is stationary due to the superfluidity of the
condensate. at intermediate speeds, we observe a non-stationary regime in which
the condensate gets filled with dark solitons. at faster speeds, soliton
formation completely ceases and a remarkable absence of excitation in the
condensate is seen again.

of relativistic heavy-ion collisions) the eddy viscosity in the shear mode is
negative, reducing the effective viscosity below its microscopic value. this

"we develop a formalism to model slowly rotating superfluid newtonian neutron
stars. a two-fluid model is used to describe the matter, where one fluid is the
superfluid neutrons that are believed to exist in the inner crust and core of
mature neutron stars, while the other fluid is a charge neutral conglomerate of
the remaining constituents (crust nuclei, core superconducting protons,
electrons, etc). we include the entrainment effect, which is a non-dissipative
interaction between the two fluids whereby a momentum induced in one of the
fluids will cause part of the mass of the other fluid to be carried along. the
equations that describe rotational equilibria (i.e. axisymmetric and stationary
configurations) are approximated using the slow-rotation approximation; an
expansion in terms of the rotation rates of the two fluids where only terms up
to second-order are kept. our formalism allows the neutrons to rotate at a rate
different from that of the charged constituents. for a particular equation of
state that is quadratic in the two mass-densities and relative velocities of
the fluids, we find an analytic solution to the slow-rotation equations. this
result provides an elegant generalisation to the two-fluid problem of the
standard expressions for the one-fluid polytrope ${\cal e} \propto \rho^2$. the
model equation of state includes entrainment and is general enough to allow for
realistic values for, say, mass and radius of the star. it also includes a term
that can be related to ``symmetry energy'' terms that appear in more realistic
equations of state. we use the analytic solution to explore how relative
rotation between the two fluids, the ``symmetry energy'' term, and entrainment

investigate the evolution of the real contact area, maximal frictional traction
and global coefficient of friction under increasing external pressure. elastic
and elasto-plastic material models, compressible and incompressible fluid
models and different geometrical characteristics of the wavy surface are used.
we show that in case of incompressible fluid, due to its pressurization, the
real contact area and the global coefficient of friction decrease monotonically
with the increasing external pressure. ultimately the contact opens and the
fluid occupies the entire interface resulting in vanishing of static friction.
in case of compressible fluids with pressure-dependent bulk modulus, we
demonstrate a non-monotonous behaviour of the global coefficient of friction
due to a competition between non-linear evolution of the contact area and of
the fluid pressure. however, for realistic compressibility of solids and
fluids, contact-opening cannot be reached at realistic pressures. an asymptotic
analytical result for the trap-opening pressure is found and shown to be
independent of the surface slope if it is small. on the other hand, in case of
elastic-perfectly plastic materials, we again observe fluid permeation into the
contact interface. finally, we study the distribution of frictional tractions
during the depletion of the contact area under increasing pressure. this
process leads to emergence of singularity-like peaks in the tangential
tractions (bounded by the coulomb's limit) near the contact edges. we point out

"we present the extension of an efficient and highly parallelisable framework
for incompressible fluid flow simulations to viscoplastic fluids. the system is
governed by incompressible conservation of mass, the cauchy momentum equation

of viscoplastic fluids, we employ the herschel-bulkley model for yield-stress
fluids with nonlinear stress-strain dependency above the yield limit. we
utilise papanastasiou regularisation in our algorithm to deal with the
singularity in apparent viscosity. the resulting system of partial differential
equations is solved using the iamr code (incompressible adaptive mesh
refinement), which uses second-order godunov methodology for the advective

"a novel method for complex fluid-structure interaction (fsi) involving large
structural deformation and motion is proposed. the new approach is based on a
hybrid fluid formulation that combines the advantages of purely eulerian
(fixed-grid) and arbitrary-lagrangian-eulerian (ale moving mesh) formulations
in the context of fsi. the structure - as commonly given in lagrangian
description - is surrounded by a fine resolved layer of fluid elements based on
an ale-framework. this ale-fluid patch, which is embedded in an eulerian
background fluid domain, follows the deformation and motion of the structural
interface. this approximation technique is not limited to finite element
methods, but can can also be realized within other frameworks like finite
volume or discontinuous galerkin methods. in this work, the surface coupling
between the two disjoint fluid subdomains is imposed weakly using a stabilized
nitsche's technique in a cut finite element method (cutfem) framework. at the
fluid-solid interface, standard weak coupling of node-matching or non-matching
finite element approximations can be utilized. as the fluid subdomains can be
meshed independently, a sufficient mesh quality in the vicinity of the common
fluid-structure interface can be assured. to our knowledge the proposed method
is the only method (despite some overlapping domain decomposition approaches
that suffer from other issues) that allows for capturing boundary layers and
flow detachment via appropriate grids around largely moving and deforming
bodies and is able to do this e.g. without the necessity of costly remeshing
procedures. in addition it might also help to safe computational costs as now
background grids can be much coarser. various fsi-cases of rising complexity

"in part 2 of our guide to collisionless fluid models, we concentrate on
landau fluid closures. these closures were pioneered by hammett and perkins and
allow for the rigorous incorporation of collisionless landau damping into a
fluid framework. it is landau damping that sharply separates traditional fluid
models and collisionless kinetic theory, and is the main reason why the usual
fluid models do not converge to the kinetic description, even in the
long-wavelength low-frequency limit. we start with a brief introduction to
kinetic theory, where we discuss in detail the plasma dispersion function
$z(\zeta)$, and the associated plasma response function $r(\zeta)=1+\zeta
z(\zeta)=-z'(\zeta)/2$. we then consider a 1d (electrostatic) geometry and make
a significant effort to map all possible landau fluid closures that can be
constructed at the 4th-order moment level. these closures for parallel moments
have general validity from the largest astrophysical scales down to the debye
length, and we verify their validity by considering examples of the (proton and
electron) landau damping of the ion-acoustic mode, and the electron landau
damping of the langmuir mode. we proceed by considering 1d closures at
higher-order moments than the 4th-order, and as was concluded in part 1, this
is not possible without landau fluid closures. we show that it is possible to
reproduce linear landau damping in the fluid framework to any desired
precision, thus showing the convergence of the fluid and collisionless kinetic
descriptions. we then consider a 3d (electromagnetic) geometry in the
gyrotropic (long-wavelength low-frequency) limit and map all closures that are
available at the 4th-order moment level. in the appendix a, we provide

"a new model for the numerical simulation of a rigid body moving in a viscous
fluid flow using fem is presented. one of the most interesting features of this
approach is the small computational effort required to solve the motion of the
rigid body compared to a pure fluid solver. the model is based on the idea of
extending the fluid velocity inside the rigid body and solving the flow
equations with a penalization term to enforce rigid motion inside the solid. in
order to get the velocity field in the fluid domain the navier-stokes equations
for an incompressible viscous flow are solved using a fractional-step procedure
combined with the two-step taylor-galerkin for the fractional linear momentum.
once the velocity field in the fluid domain is computed, calculation of the
rigid motion is obtained by averaging translation and angular velocities over
the solid. one of the main challenges when dealing with the fluid-solid
interaction is the proper modelling of the interface which separates the solid
moving mass from the viscous fluid. in this work the combination of the level
set technique and the two-step taylor-galerkin algorithm for tracking the
fluid-solid interface is proposed. the good properties exhibited by the
two-step taylor-galerkin, minimizing oscillations and numerical diffusion, make
this method suitable to accurately advect the solid domain avoiding distortions
at its boundaries, and thus preserving the initial size and shape of the rigid
body. the proposed model has been validated against empirical solutions,
experimental data and numerical simulations found in the literature. in all
tested cases, the numerical results have shown to be accurate, proving the
potential of the proposed model as a valuable tool for the numerical analysis

equilibria in which the two fluids move together, the total density is uniform,
and the densities of the two components are proportional to one another, with
ratios that are independent of position. the motions of the two fluids are
coupled by mutual friction, as formulated by khalatnikov. we show that there
are two general classes of modes for small perturbations: one class in which
the two fluids move together and the other in which there is relative motion
between them. the former are identical to the modes found for a single fluid,
except that the rate of viscous dissipation, when computed in the secular (or
``low reynolds number'') approximation under the assumption of a constant
kinematic viscosity, is diminished by a factor $f_n$, the fraction of the total
mass in the normal fluid. the relative modes are completely new, and are
studied in detail for a range of values for the phenomenological mutual
friction coefficients, relative densities of the superfluid and normal
components, and, for roche ellipsoids, binary mass ratios. we find that there
are no new secular instabilities connected with the relative motions of the two

"we study the structure and reveal the physical nature of the reversed
granulation pattern in the solar photosphere by means of 3-dimensional
radiative hydrodynamics simulations. we used the muram code to obtain a
realistic model of the near-surface layers of the convection zone and the
photosphere. the pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations at the base of
the photosphere consists of relatively hot granular cells bounded by the cooler
intergranular downflow network. with increasing height in the photosphere, the
amplitude of the temperature fluctuations diminishes. at a height of z=130-140
km in the photosphere, the pattern of horizontal temperature fluctuations
reverses so that granular regions become relatively cool compared to the
intergranular network. detailed analysis of the trajectories of fluid elements
through the photosphere reveal that the motion of the fluid is non-adiabatic,
owing to strong radiative cooling when approaching the surface of optical depth
unity followed by reheating by the radiation field from below. the temperature
structure of the photosphere results from the competition between expansion of
rising fluid elements and radiative heating. the former acts to lower the
temperature of the fluid whereas the latter acts to increase it towards the
radiative equilibrium temperature with a net entropy gain. after the fluid
overturns and descends towards the convection zone, radiative energy loss again
decreases the entropy of the fluid. radiative heating and cooling of fluid
elements that penetrate into the photosphere and overturn do not occur in equal
amounts. the imbalance in the cumulative heating and cooling of these fluid
elements is responsible for the reversal of temperature fluctuations with
respect to height in the photosphere.

"the behaviour of two dimensional binary and ternary amphiphilic fluids under
flow conditions is investigated using a hydrodynamic lattice gas model. after
the validation of the model in simple cases (poiseuille flow, darcy's law for
single component fluids), attention is focussed on the properties of binary
immiscible fluids in porous media. an extension of darcy's law which explicitly
admits a viscous coupling between the fluids is verified, and evidence of
capillary effects are described. the influence of a third component, namely
surfactant, is studied in the same context. invasion simulations have also been
performed. the effect of the applied force on the invasion process is reported.
as the forcing level increases, the invasion process becomes faster and the
residual oil saturation decreases. the introduction of surfactant in the
invading phase during imbibition produces new phenomena, including
emulsification and micellisation. at very low fluid forcing levels, this leads
to the production of a low-resistance gel, which then slows down the progress
of the invading fluid. at long times (beyond the water percolation threshold),
the concentration of remaining oil within the porous medium is lowered by the
action of surfactant, thus enhancing oil recovery. on the other hand, the
introduction of surfactant in the invading phase during drainage simulations
slows down the invasion process -- the invading fluid takes a more tortuous
path to invade the porous medium -- and reduces the oil recovery (the residual
oil saturation increases).

"we have used two-fluid dynamics to study the discrepancy between the work of
thouless, ao and niu (tan) and that of iordanskii. in tan no transverse force
on a vortex due to normal fluid flow was found, whereas the earlier work found
a transverse force proportional to normal fluid velocity u and normal fluid
density. we have linearized the time-independent two-fluid equations about the
exact solution for a vortex, and find three solutions which are important in
the region far from the vortex. uniform superfluid flow gives rise to the usual
superfluid magnus force. uniform normal fluid flow gives rise to no forces in
the linear region, but does not satisfy reasonable boundary conditions at short
distances. a logarithmically increasing normal fluid flow gives a viscous
force. as in classical hydrodynamics, and as in the early work of hall and
vinen, this logarithmic increase must be cut off by nonlinear effects at large
distances; this gives a viscous force proportional to u/ln(u), and a transverse
contribution which goes like u/(ln u)^2, even in the absence of an explicit
iordanskii force. in the limit u goes to zero the tan result is obtained, but
at nonzero u there are important corrections that were not found in tan. we
argue that the magnus force in a superfluid at nonzero temperature is an
example of a topological relation for which finite-size corrections may be
large.

"the density profile and gibbs adsorption of a near-critical fluid confined
between two identical planar walls is studied by means of
  monte carlo simulation and by density functional theory for a lennard-jones
fluid. by reducing the strength of wall-fluid interactions relative to
fluid-fluid interactions we observe a crossover from behaviour characteristic
of the normal surface universality class, strong critical adsorption, to
behaviour characteristic of a 'neutral' wall. the crossover is reminiscent of
that which occurs near the ordinary surface transition in ising films subject
to vanishing surface fields. for the 'neutral' wall the density profile, away
from the walls, is almost constant throughout the slit capillary and gives rise
to an adsorption that is constant along the critical isochore. the same
'neutral' wall yields a line of capillary coexistence that is almost identical
to the bulk coexistence line. in the crossover regime we observe features in
the density profile similar to those found in the magnetisation profile of the
critical ising film subject to weak surface fields, namely two smooth maxima,
located away from the walls, which merge into a single maximum at midpoint as
the strength of the wall-fluid interaction is reduced or as the distance
between walls is decreased. we discuss similarities and differences between the

closely-fitting spherical and ellipsoidal particles moving through a
fluid-filled cylinder at nanometer scales. the particle, the cylinder wall and
the fluid solvent are all treated as atomic systems, and special attention is
given to the effects of varying the wetting properties of the fluid. although
the modification of the solid-fluid interaction leads to significant changes in
the microstructure of the fluid, its transport properties are found to be the
same as in bulk. independently of the shape and relative size of the particle,
we find two distinct regimes as a function of the degree of wetting, with a
sharp transition between them. in the case of a highly-wetting suspending
fluid, the particle moves through the cylinder with an average axial velocity
in agreement with that obtained from the solution of the continuum stokes
equations. in contrast, in the case of less-wetting fluids, only the early-time
motion of the particle is consistent with continuum dynamics. at later times,
the particle is eventually adsorbed onto the wall and subsequently executes an
intermittent stick-slip motion.we show that van der walls forces are the
dominant contribution to the particle adsorption phenomenon and that depletion
forces are weak enough to allow, in the highly-wetting situation, an initially

"general relativistic superfluid neutron stars have a significantly more
intricate dynamics than their ordinary fluid counterparts. superfluidity allows
different superfluid (and superconducting) species of particles to have
independent fluid flows, a consequence of which is that the fluid equations of
motion contain as many fluid element velocities as superfluid species. whenever
the particles of one superfluid interact with those of another, the momentum of
each superfluid will be a linear combination of both superfluid velocities.
this leads to the so-called entrainment effect whereby the motion of one
superfluid will induce a momentum in the other superfluid. we have constructed
a fully relativistic model for entrainment between superfluid neutrons and
superconducting protons using a relativistic $\sigma - \omega$ mean field model
for the nucleons and their interactions. in this context there are two notions
of ``relativistic'': relativistic motion of the individual nucleons with
respect to a local region of the star (i.e. a fluid element containing, say, an
avogadro's number of particles), and the motion of fluid elements with respect
to the rest of the star. while it is the case that the fluid elements will
typically maintain average speeds at a fraction of that of light, the
supranuclear densities in the core of a neutron star can make the nucleons
themselves have quite high average speeds within each fluid element. the
formalism is applied to the problem of slowly-rotating superfluid neutron star
configurations, a distinguishing characteristic being that the neutrons can
rotate at a rate different from that of the protons.

the two-layer quasigeostrophic model under stochastic wind forcing. we first
transformed this system into a coupled system of random partial differential

including dissipation and entrainment (i.e. allowing the momentum of one fluid
to be a linear combination of the velocities of all fluids). maximum use is
made of mass, energy, and linear and angular momentum conservation to specify
the equations of motion. also used extensively are insights gleaned from a
convective variational action principle, key being the distinction between each
velocity and its canonically conjugate momentum. dissipation is incorporated to
second order in the ``thermodynamic forces'' via the approach pioneered by
onsager. an immediate goal of the investigation is to understand better the
number, and form, of independent dissipation terms required for a consistent
set of equations of motion in the multi-fluid context. a significant, but
seemingly innocuous detail, is that one must be careful to isolate ``forces''
that can be written as total gradients, otherwise errors can be made in
relating the net internal force to the net externally applied force. our
long-range aim is to provide a formalism that can be used to model dynamical
multi-fluid systems both perturbatively and via fully nonlinear 3d numerical
evolutions. to elucidate the formalism we consider the standard model for a
heat-conducting, superfluid neutron star, which is believed to be dominated by
superfluid neutrons, superconducting protons, and a highly degenerate,
ultra-relativistic gas of normal fluid electrons. we determine that in this

these simulations show that the pronounced inhomogeneous structuring of the

functional theory studies, has a negligible effect on many of its average
properties over a surprisingly broad range of conditions. we present one
consequence of this insensitivity to confinement: a simple analytical equation
relating the average density of the confined fluid to that of the bulk fluid
with equal activity. nontrivial implications of confinement for average fluid
properties do emerge in this system, but only when the fluid is both (i) dense
and (ii) confined to a gap smaller than approximately three particle diameters.
for this limited set of conditions, we find that ""in-phase"" oscillatory
deviations in excess entropy and self-diffusivity (relative to the behavior of
the bulk fluid at the same average density) occur as a function of gap size.

"in a variety of biological situations, swimming cells have to move through
complex fluids. similarly, mucociliary clearance involves the transport of
polymeric fluids by beating cilia. here, we consider the extent to which
complex fluids could be exploited for force generation on small scales. we
consider a prototypical reciprocal motion (i.e. identical under time-reversal
symmetry): the periodic flapping of a tethered semi-infinite plane. in the
newtonian limit, such motion cannot be used for force generation according to
purcell's scallop theorem. in a polymeric fluid (oldroyd-b, and its
generalization), we show that this is not the case and calculate explicitly the
forces on the flapper for small-amplitude sinusoidal motion. three setups are
considered: a flapper near a wall, a flapper in a wedge, and a two-dimensional
scallop-like flapper. in all cases, we show that at quadratic order in the
oscillation amplitude, the tethered flapping motion induces net forces but no
average flow. our results demonstrate therefore that the scallop theorem is not
valid in polymeric fluids. the reciprocal component of the movement of
biological appendages such as cilia can thus generate nontrivial forces in
polymeric fluid such as mucus, and normal-stress differences can be exploited

direction and stochastic in the wall-normal direction and in time. an explicit
reynolds number scaling of frequency responses from different forcing to
different velocity components is developed, showing the same $re$-dependence as
in newtonian fluids. it is found that some of the frequency response components
peak at non-zero temporal frequencies. this is in contrast to newtonian fluids,
where peaks are always observed at zero frequency, suggesting that viscoelastic
effects introduce additional timescales and promote development of flow
patterns with smaller time constants than in newtonian fluids. the temporal
frequencies, corresponding to the peaks in the components of frequency
response, decrease with an increase in viscosity ratio (ratio of solvent
viscosity to total viscosity) and show maxima for non-zero elasticity number.

term involving the streamwise/wall-normal polymer stress component $\tau_{xy}$
and the wall-normal gradient of the streamwise velocity $\partial_y u$ becomes
increasingly important relative to the reynolds stress term as the elasticity

$\rho_s$ that scales as $a^{-6}$, where $a$ is the scale factor, have been

of such a stiff fluid on the primordial element abundances. because the stiff
fluid energy density decreases with the scale factor more rapidly than
radiation, it produces a relatively larger change in the primordial helium-4
abundance than in the other element abundances, relative to the changes
produced by an additional radiation component. we show that the helium-4
abundance varies linearly with the density of the stiff fluid at a fixed
fiducial temperature. taking $\rho_{s10}$ and $\rho_{r10}$ to be the stiff
fluid energy density and the standard density in relativistic particles,
respectively, at $t = 10$ mev, we find that the change in the primordial helium

minimum at low shear rates and then increases rapidly at higher shear rates. we
found that at sufficiently high shear rates, the slip flow over atomically flat
crystalline surfaces is anisotropic. it is demonstrated numerically that the
friction coefficient at the liquid-solid interface (the ratio of viscosity and
slip length) undergoes a transition from a constant value to the power-law
decay as a function of the slip velocity. the characteristic velocity of the
transition correlates well with the diffusion velocity of fluid monomers in the
first fluid layer near the solid wall at equilibrium. we also show that in the

applies to the simplest galileons and k-essence. the fluid variables not only
have a clear physical meaning but also drastically simplify the analysis of the
system. the fluid carries charges corresponding to shifts in field space. this
shift-charge current contains a spatial part responsible for diffusion of the
charges. moreover, in the incompressible limit, the equation of motion becomes
the standard diffusion equation. the fluid is indeed imperfect because the
energy flows neither along the field gradient nor along the shift current. the
fluid has zero vorticity and is not dissipative: there is no entropy
production, the energy-momentum is exactly conserved, the temperature vanishes
and there is no shear viscosity. still, in an expansion around a perfect fluid
one can identify terms which correct the pressure in the manner of bulk
viscosity. we close by formulating the non-trivial conditions for the
thermodynamic equilibrium of this imperfect fluid.

"we consider the behaviour of a dielectric fluid-fluid interface in the
presence of a strong electric field from a point charge and line charge,
respectively, both statically and, in the latter case, dynamically. the fluid
surface is elevated above its undisturbed level until balance is reached
between the electromagnetic lifting force, gravity and surface tension. we
derive ordinary differential equations for the shape of the fluid-fluid
interface which are solved numerically with standard means, demonstrating how
the elevation depends on field strength and surface tension coefficient. in the
dynamic case of a moving line charge, the surface of an inviscid liquid-liquid
interface is left to oscillate behind the moving charge after it has been
lifted against the force of gravity. we show how the wavelength of the
oscillations depends on the relative strength of the forces of gravity and
inertia, whereas the amplitude of the oscillations is a nontrivial function of
the velocity at which the line charge moves.

"this dissertation is about the study of three important issues in the theory
of relativistic fluid dynamics: the stability of dissipative fluid dynamics,
the shear viscosity, and fluid dynamics with triangle anomaly.(1)the second
order theory of fluid dynamics is necessary for causality. however the
causality cannot be guaranteed for all parameters. the constraints for
parameters are then given. we also point out that the causality and the
stability are inter-correlated. it is found that a causal system must be
stable, but an acausal system in the boost frame at high speed must be
unstable. (2)the transport coefficients can be determined in kinetic theory. we
will firstly discuss about derivation of the shear viscosity via variational
method in the boltzmann equation. secondly, we will compute the shear viscosity
via ads/cft duality in a bjorken boost invariant fluid with radial flow. it is
found that the ratio of the shear viscosity to entropy density is consistent
with the work of policastro, son and starinets. as another application of
ads/cft duality, we also investigate the property of baryons in the strongly
coupled plasma. (3)as the last topic, we investigate the fluid dynamics with
quantum triangle anomalies. recently it is pointed out that the vorticity has
to be introduced to relativistic fluid dynamics with anomalies to satisfy the
second law of thermodynamics. these new terms are also relevant to the chiral
magnetic effect. we find such terms can be derived from the kinetic approach.
the coefficients of the vorticity are also evaluated.

"fluid mechanical peristaltic transport through esophagus has been of concern
in the paper. a mathematical model has been developed with an aim to study the
peristaltic transport of a rheological fluid for arbitrary wave shapes and tube
lengths. the ostwald-de waele power law of viscous fluid is considered here to
depict the non-newtonian behaviour of the fluid. the model is formulated and
analyzed with the specific aim of exploring some important information
concerning the movement of food bolus through the esophagus. the analysis has
been carried out by using lubrication theory. the study is particularly
suitable for cases where the reynolds number is small. the esophagus is treated
as a circular tube through which the transport of food bolus takes places by
periodic contraction of the esophageal wall. variation of different variables
concerned with the transport phenomena such as pressure, flow velocity,
particle trajectory and reflux are investigated for a single wave as well as
for a train of periodic peristaltic waves. locally variable pressure is seen to
be highly sensitive to the flow index `n'. the study clearly shows that
continuous fluid transport for newtonian/rheological fluids by wave train
propagation is much more effective than widely spaced single wave propagation
in the case of peristaltic movement of food bolus in the esophagus.

"stability of coarse particles against gravity is an important issue in dense
suspensions (fresh concrete, foodstuff, etc.). on the one hand, it is known
that they are stable at rest when the interstitial paste has a high enough
yield stress; on the other hand, it is not yet possible to predict if a given
material will remain homogeneous during a flow. using mri techniques, we study
the time evolution of the particle volume fraction during the flows in a
couette geometry of model density-mismatched suspensions of noncolloidal
particles in yield stress fluids. we observe that shear induces sedimentation
of the particles in all systems, which are stable at rest. the sedimentation
velocity is observed to increase with increasing shear rate and particle
diameter, and to decrease with increasing yield stress of the interstitial
fluid. at low shear rate ('plastic regime'), we show that this phenomenon can
be modelled by considering that the interstitial fluid behaves like a viscous
fluid -- of viscosity equal to the apparent viscosity of the sheared fluid --
in the direction orthogonal to shear. the behavior at higher shear rates, when
viscous effects start to be important, is also discussed. we finally study the
dependence of the sedimentation velocity on the particle volume fraction, and
show that its modelling requires estimating the local shear rate in the
interstitial fluid.

"when a fluid comprised of multiple phases or constituents flows through a
network, non-linear phenomena such as multiple stable equilibrium states and
spontaneous oscillations can occur. such behavior has been observed or
predicted in a number of networks including the flow of blood through the
microcirculation, the flow of picoliter droplets through microfluidic devices,
the flow of magma through lava tubes, and two-phase flow in refrigeration
systems. while the existence of non-linear phenomena in a network with many
inter-connections containing fluids with complex rheology may seem
unsurprising, this paper demonstrates that even simple networks containing
newtonian fluids in laminar flow can demonstrate multiple equilibria.
  the paper describes a theoretical and experimental investigation of the
laminar flow of two miscible newtonian fluids of different density and
viscosity through a simple network. the fluids stratify due to gravity and
remain as nearly distinct phases with some mixing occurring only by diffusion.
this fluid system has the advantage that it is easily controlled and modeled,
yet contains the key ingredients for network non-linearities. experiments and
3d simulations are first used to explore how phases distribute at a single
t-junction. once the phase separation at a single junction is known, a network
model is developed which predicts multiple equilibria in the simplest of
networks. the existence of multiple stable equilibria is confirmed
experimentally and a criteria for their existence is developed. the network
results are generic and could be applied to or found in different physical

i. siegel was curious if the wetting fluid would expel from the end of short
capillary tubes in a low-gravity environment. he observed that although the
fluid partially left the tubes, it was always pulled back by surface tension,
which caused the fluid to remain pinned to the tubes' end. by exploiting tube

method, the field equations are solved up to $\mathcal{o}(\epsilon^2)$ in the
nondynamical model. it is shown that there exists nonvortical dual fluid with
shear viscosity $\eta$ and hall viscosity $\eta_a$ on the cutoff surface
$\sigma_c$. the ratio of shear viscosity over entropy density $\eta/s$ of the
fluid takes the universal value $1/{4\pi}$, while the ratio of hall viscosity
over entropy density $\eta_a/s$ depends on the $\sigma_c$ and black brane
charge $q$. moreover the nonvortical dual fluid obeys the magnetohydrodynamic
(mhd) equation. however, these kinematic viscosities $\nu$ and $\nu_a$ related
to $\eta$ and $\eta_a$ do not appear in this mhd equation, due to the
constraint condition $\tilde{\partial}^2\beta_j=0$ for the $(2+1)$-dimensional

and show that the dual vortical fluid possesses another so-called curl
viscosity $\zeta_a$, whose ratio to entropy density $\zeta_a/s$ also depends on
the $\sigma_c$ and $q$. moreover, the value of $\eta/s$ still equals to
$1/4\pi$ and the result of $\eta_a/s$ agrees to the previous result under the

"the evolution of the interface separating a conduit of light, viscous fluid
rising buoyantly through a heavy, more viscous, exterior fluid at small
reynolds numbers is governed by the interplay between nonlinearity and
dispersion. previous authors have proposed an approximate model equation based
on physical arguments, but a precise theoretical treatment for this two fluid
system with a free boundary is lacking. here, a derivation of the interfacial
equation via a multiple scales, perturbation technique is presented.
perturbations about a state of vertically uniform, laminar conduit flow are
considered in the context of the navier-stokes equations with appropriate
boundary conditions. the ratio of interior to exterior viscosities is the small
parameter used in the asymptotic analysis, which leads systematically to a
maximal balance between buoyancy driven, nonlinear self-steepening and viscous,
interfacial stress induced, nonlinear dispersion. this results in a scalar,
nonlinear partial differential equation describing large amplitude dynamics of
the cross-sectional area of the intrusive fluid conduit, in agreement with
previous derivations. the leading order behavior of the two fluid system is
completely characterized in terms of the interfacial dynamics. the regime of
model validity is characterized and shown to agree with previous experimental
studies. viscous fluid conduits provide a robust setting for the study of

"we analyze the creeping flow generated by a spherical particle moving through
a viscous fluid with nematic directional order, in which momentum diffusivity
is anisotropic and which opposes resistance to bending. specifically, we
provide closed-form analytical expressions for the response function, i.e. the
equivalent to stokes's drag formula for nematic fluids. particular attention is
given to the rotationally pseudo-isotropic condition defined by zero resistance
to bending, and to the strain pseudo-isotropic condition defined by isotropic
momentum diffusivity. we find the former to be consistent with the rheology of
biopolymer networks and the latter to be closer to the rheology of nematic
liquid crystals. these ""pure"" anisotropic conditions are used to benchmark
existing particle tracking microrheology methods that provide effective
directional viscosities by applying stokes's drag law separately in different
directions. we find that the effective viscosity approach is phenomenologically
justified in rotationally isotropic fluids, although it leads to significant
errors in the estimated viscosity coefficients. on the other hand, the mere
concept of directional effective viscosities is found to be misleading in
fluids that oppose an appreciable resistance to bending. finally, we observe
that anisotropic momentum diffusivity leads to asymmetric streamline patterns
displaying enhanced (reduced) streamline deflection in the directions of lower
(higher) diffusivity. the bending resistance of the fluid is found to modulate
the asymmetry of streamline deflection. in some cases, the combined effects of
both anisotropy mechanisms leads to streamline patterns that converge towards
the sphere.

pressure and solid velocity. this combined field formulation uses arbitrary
lagrangian eulerian (ale) description for the fluid and lagrangian description
for the solid. it automatically enforces the simultaneous continuities of both
velocity and traction along the fs interface. we present a first order in time
fully discrete scheme when the flow is incompressible navier-stokes and when
the solid is elastic. the interface position is determined by first order
extrapolation so that the generation of the fluid mesh and the computation of
(u;p;v) are decoupled. this explicit interface advancing enables us to save
half of the unknowns comparing with traditional monolithic schemes. when the
solid has convex strain energy (e.g. linear elastic), we prove that the total
energy of the fluid and the solid at time t^{n} is bounded by the total energy
at time t^{n-1}. like in the continuous case, the fluid mesh velocity which is
used in ale description does not enter into the stability bound. surprisingly,
the nonlinear convection term in the navier-stokes equations plays a crucial
role to stabilize the scheme and the stability result does not apply to stokes
flow. as the nonlinear convection term is treated semi-implicitly, in each time
step, we only need to solve a linear system (and only once) which involves
merely (u;p;v) if the solid is linear elastic. two numerical tests including
the benchmark test of navier-stokes flow past a saint venant-kirchhoff elastic

fluid-composite structure interaction. the benchmark problem proposed here
consists of an incompressible, viscous fluid interacting with a composite
structure that consists of two layers: a thin elastic layer which is in contact
with the fluid, and a thick elastic layer which sits on top of the thin layer.
the motivation comes from fluid-structure interaction (fsi) in hemodyam- ics.
the equations of linear elasticity are used to model the thick structural
layer, while the koiter member/shell equations are used to model the thin
structural layer which serves as fluid-structure interface with mass. an effi-
cient, modular, operator-splitting scheme is proposed to simulate solutions to
the coupled, nonlinear fsi problem. the operator splitting scheme sepa- rates
the elastodynamics structure problem, from a fluid problem in which the thin
structure inertia is included as a robin-type boundary condition to achieve
unconditional stability, without requiring any sub-iterations within
time-steps. an energy estimate associated with unconditional stability is
derived for the fully nonlinear fsi problem defined on moving domains. two
instructive numerical examples are presented to test the performance of the
scheme, where it is shown numerically, that the scheme is at least first-order
accurate in time. the second example reveals a new phenomenon in fsi problems:
the presence of a thin fluid-structure interface with mass regularizes

"in this paper we investigate both theoretically and numerically the forward
in time (fit) and backward in time (bit) dispersion of fluid and inertial
particle pairs in isotropic turbulence. fluid particles are known to separate
faster bit than fit in three-dimensional turbulence, and we find that inertial
particles do the same. however, we find that the irreversibility in the
inertial particle dispersion is in general much stronger than that for fluid
particles. for example, the ratio of the bit to fit mean-square separation can
be up to an order of magnitude larger for inertial particles than for the fluid
particles. we also find that for both the inertial and fluid particles the
irreversibility becomes stronger as the scale of their separation decreases.
regarding the physical mechanism for the irreversibility, we argue that whereas
the irreversibility of fluid particle-pair dispersion can be understood in
terms of a directional bias arising from the energy transfer process in
turbulence, inertial particles experience an additional source of
irreversibility arising from the non-local contribution to their velocity
dynamics, a contribution which vanishes in the limit ${st\to0}$, where $st$ is
the particle stokes number. for each given initial (final, in the backward in
time case) separation $\bm{r}^0$ there is an optimum value of $st$ for which
the dispersion irreversibility is strongest, as such particles are optimally

"compressing a porous, fluid-filled material will drive the interstitial fluid
out of the pore space, as when squeezing water out of a kitchen sponge.
inversely, injecting fluid into a porous material can deform the solid
structure, as when fracturing a shale for natural gas recovery. these
poromechanical interactions play an important role in geological and biological
systems across a wide range of scales, from the propagation of magma through
the earth's mantle to the transport of fluid through living cells and tissues.
the theory of poroelasticity has been largely successful in modeling
poromechanical behavior in relatively simple systems, but this continuum theory
is fundamentally limited by our understanding of the pore-scale interactions
between the fluid and the solid, and these problems are notoriously difficult
to study in a laboratory setting. here, we present a high-resolution
measurement of injection-driven poromechanical deformation in a system with
granular microsctructure: we inject fluid into a dense, confined monolayer of
soft particles and use particle tracking to reveal the dynamics of the
multi-scale deformation field. we find that a continuum model based on
poroelasticity theory captures certain macroscopic features of the deformation,
but the particle-scale deformation field exhibits dramatic departures from
smooth, continuum behavior. we observe particle-scale rearrangement and
hysteresis, as well as petal-like mesoscale structures that are connected to
material failure through spiral shear banding.

"routing mechanisms for stochastic networks are often designed to produce
state space collapse (ssc) in a heavy-traffic limit, i.e., to confine the
limiting process to a lower-dimensional subset of its full state space. in a
fluid limit, a control producing asymptotic ssc corresponds to an ideal sliding
mode control that forces the fluid trajectories to a lower-dimensional sliding
manifold. within deterministic dynamical systems theory, it is well known that
sliding-mode controls can cause the system to chatter back and forth along the
sliding manifold due to delays in activation of the control. for the prelimit
stochastic system, chattering implies fluid-scaled fluctuations that are larger
than typical stochastic fluctuations. in this paper we show that chattering can
occur in the fluid limit of a controlled stochastic network when inappropriate
control parameters are used. the model has two large service pools operating
under the fixed-queue-ratio with activation and release thresholds (fqr-art)
overload control which we proposed in a recent paper. we now show that, if the
control parameters are not chosen properly, then delays in activating and
releasing the control can cause chattering with large oscillations in the fluid
limit. in turn, these fluid-scaled fluctuations lead to severe congestion, even
when the arrival rates are smaller than the potential total service rate in the
system, a phenomenon referred to as congestion collapse. we show that the fluid
limit can be a bi-stable switching system possessing a unique nontrivial
periodic equilibrium, in addition to a unique stationary point.

"gravity/fluid correspondence becomes an important tool to investigate the

the boundary fluids at the finite cutoff surface is critical to clarify the
superficial similarity between bulk viscosity and perturbation of the pressure
for the holographic fluid, where we set a special boundary condition at the
finite cutoff surface to explicitly express this superficial similarity.
moreover, we further take the sonic velocity into account to investigate a case
with more general boundary condition. in this more general case, two parameters
in the first order stress tensor of holographic fluid cannot be fixed, one can
still extract the information of transport coefficients by considering the
sonic velocity seriously.

"packing frustration for confined fluids, i.e., the incompatibility between
the preferred packing of the fluid particles and the packing constraints
imposed by the confining surfaces, is studied for a dense hard-sphere fluid
confined between planar hard surfaces at short separations. the detailed
mechanism for the frustration is investigated via an analysis of the
anisotropic pair distributions of the confined fluid, as obtained from integral
equation theory for inhomogeneous fluids at pair correlation level within the
anisotropic percus-yevick approximation. by examining the mean forces that
arise from interparticle collisions around the periphery of each particle in
the slit, we calculate the principal components of the mean force for the
density profile - each component being the sum of collisional forces on a
particle's hemisphere facing either surface. the variations of these components
with the slit width give rise to rather intricate changes in the layer
structure between the surfaces, but, as shown in this paper, the basis of these
variations can be easily understood qualitatively and often also
semi-quantitatively. it is found that the ordering of the fluid is in essence
governed locally by the packing constraints at each single solid-fluid
interface. a simple superposition of forces due to the presence of each surface
gives surprisingly good estimates of the density profiles, but there remain
nontrivial confinement effects that cannot be explained by superposition, most
notably the magnitude of the excess adsorption of particles in the slit
relative to bulk.

"this paper derives stochastic partial differential equations (spdes) for
fluid dynamics from a stochastic variational principle (svp). the legendre

stochastic stratonovich fluid equations; writing their it\^o representation;
and then investigating the properties of these stochastic fluid models in
comparison with each other, and with the corresponding deterministic fluid
models. the circulation properties of the stochastic stratonovich fluid
equations are found to closely mimic those of the deterministic ideal fluid
models. as with deterministic ideal flows, motion along the stochastic
stratonovich paths also preserves the helicity of the vortex field lines in
incompressible stochastic flows. however, these stratonovich properties are not
apparent in the equivalent it\^o representation, because they are disguised by
the quadratic covariation drift term arising in the stratonovich to it\^o
transformation. this term is a geometric generalisation of the quadratic
covariation drift term already found for scalar densities in stratonovich's

number beyond which computations fail to converge is found to increase with
increasing dimensionless solid elasticity parameter {\gamma}, following the
trend owens > fene- p > oldroyd-b. the highly shear thinning nature of owens
model leads to the elastic solid always collapsing into the channel, for the
wide range of values of {\gamma} considered here. in the case of the fene-p and
oldroyd-b models, however, the fluid-solid interface can be either within the
channel, or bulge outwards, depending on the value of {\gamma}. this behaviour
differs considerably from predictions of earlier models that treat the
deformable solid as a zero-thickness membrane, in which case the membrane
always lies within the channel. the capacity of the solid wall to support both
pressure and shear stress, in contrast to the zero-thickness membrane that only
responds to pressure, is responsible for the observed difference. compar- ison
of the stress and velocity fields in the channel for the three viscoelastic
fluids, with the predictions for a newtonian fluid, reveals that shear thinning
rather than elasticity is the key source of the observed differences in

"in this work, we propose and test a method for calculating stokes drag
applicable to particle-laden fluid flows where two-way momentum coupling is
important. in the point-particle formulation, particle dynamics are coupled to
fluid dynamics via a source term that appears in the respective momentum
equations. when the particle reynolds number is small and the particle diameter
is smaller than the fluid scales, it is common to approximate the momentum
coupling source term as the stokes drag. the stokes drag force depends on the
difference between the undisturbed fluid velocity evaluated at the particle
location, and the particle velocity. however, owing to two-way coupling, the
fluid velocity is modified in the neighborhood of a particle, relative to its
undisturbed value. this causes the computed stokes drag force to be
underestimated in two-way coupled point-particle simulations. we develop
estimates for the drag force error as function of the particle size relative to
the grid size. we then develop a correction method that estimates the
undisturbed fluid velocity from the computed disturbed velocity field. the
correction scheme is tested for a particle settling in an otherwise quiescent
fluid and is found to reduce the error in computed settling velocity by an
order of magnitude compared with common interpolation schemes.

"fluid-dynamical equations of motion can be derived from the boltzmann
equation in terms of an expansion around a single-particle distribution
function which is in local thermodynamical equilibrium, i.e., isotropic in
momentum space in the rest frame of a fluid element. however, in situations
where the single-particle distribution function is highly anisotropic in
momentum space, such as the initial stage of heavy-ion collisions at
relativistic energies, such an expansion is bound to break down. nevertheless,
one can still derive a fluid-dynamical theory, called anisotropic dissipative
fluid dynamics, in terms of an expansion around a single-particle distribution
function, $\hat{f}_{0\bf k}$, which incorporates (at least parts of) the
momentum anisotropy via a suitable parametrization. we construct such an
expansion in terms of polynomials in energy and momentum in the direction of
the anisotropy and of irreducible tensors in the two-dimensional momentum
subspace orthogonal to both the fluid velocity and the direction of the
anisotropy. from the boltzmann equation we then derive the set of equations of
motion for the irreducible moments of the deviation of the single-particle
distribution function from $\hat{f}_{0\bf k}$. truncating this set via the
14-moment approximation, we obtain the equations of motion of anisotropic

"we present an analytical study of oscillatory laminar shear flow over a
compliant viscoelastic layer on a rigid base. this problem relates to
oscillating blood flow in viscoelastic vessels. the deeper motivation for this
study, however, is the possible use of compliant coatings for turbulent drag
reduction. an analytical solution of the fluid and solid velocity is presented,
and five dimensionless parameters emerge. the interaction between fluid and
solid appears to be determined by a single combined dimensionless parameter,
which we call the shear interaction parameter $\chi$. the fluid satisfies a
no-slip boundary condition when $\left|\chi\right| \rightarrow 0$, which occurs
when the solid is heavy, stiff and/or thin. in contrast, the fluid obeys a
free-slip boundary condition when $\left|\chi\right| \rightarrow \infty$, which
corresponds to a lightweight and/or soft solid. three types of resonance modes
are identified for an elastic solid. two modes (odd and even) are specific to
the solid. the third mode results from the coupling with the fluid. the three
modes are less pronounced or even absent for a viscoelastic solid. these
findings have a twofold use. first, they help to understand the fluid and solid
dynamics when shear coupling is important. second, the presented analytical
solution is very useful for validation of numerical fluid-structure-interaction
solvers. future work might include the extension of the theory to multiple
viscoelastic layers and the dynamic coupling of normal stresses.

fluid-grain interactions, to understand the evolution of submerged granular
flows. the fluid phase is simulated using multiple- relaxation-time lbm

assumed during lbm computations. the collapse of granular column in fluid is

(sdpd-dv) for modeling and simulation of mesoscopic fluids in wall-bounded

the physical domain in sdpd-dv contains external and internal solid boundaries,

wall velocity, and temperature upon initialization. the fluid domain is
discretized with fluid particles placed in a global index. the algorithm for
nearest neighbor particle search is based on a combination of the linked-cell

"when the energy functional of a bose-condensed state of matter features an
effective gauge potential which depends on the density $\rho$ of the
condensate, the kinetic energy density of the matter field becomes nonlinear in
$\rho$ and additional flow-dependent terms enter the wave equation for the
phase of the condensate wavefunction. to begin with, we consider a certain
class of density-dependent `single-component' gauge potentials, and later
extend this class to encompass more general `multi-component' potentials. the
nonlinear flow terms are cast into the general form of an inner-product between
the velocity field of the fluid and the gauge potential. this is achieved by
introducing a coupling matrix of dimensionless functions $\gamma_{ij}\left(
\rho \right)$, which characterises the particular functional form of the gauge
potential and regulates the strengths of the nonlinear terms accordingly. in
the momentum-transport equation of the fluid, two non-trivial terms emerge due
to the density-dependent vector potential. a body-force of dilation appears as
a product of the gauge potential and the dilation rate of the fluid, while the
fluid stress tensor features a flow-dependent pressure contribution given by
the inner-product of the gauge potential and the current density of the fluid.
this explicit dependence of the fluid pressure on the flow highlights the lack
of galilean invariance of the nonlinear fluid.

"modal decompositions such as proper orthogonal decomposition (pod), dynamic

physical mechanisms of nonlinear flow phenomena that cannot be easily
understood through direct inspection. in fluid-structure interaction (fsi)
systems, fluid motion is coupled to vibration and/or deformation of an immersed
structure. despite this coupling, data analysis is often performed using only
fluid or structure variables, rather than incorporating both. this approach
does not provide information about the manner in which fluid and structure
modes are correlated. we present a framework for performing pod and dmd where
the fluid and structure are treated together. as part of this framework, we
introduce a physically meaningful norm for fsi systems. we first use this
combined fluid-structure formulation to identify correlated flow features and
structural motions in limit-cycle flag flapping. we then investigate the
transition from limit-cycle flapping to chaotic flapping, which can be
initiated by increasing the flag mass. our modal decomposition reveals that at
the onset of chaos, the dominant flapping motion increases in amplitude and
leads to a bluff-body wake instability. this new bluff-body mode interacts
triadically with the dominant flapping motion to produce flapping at the
non-integer harmonic frequencies previously reported by connell & yue (2007).

"how non-spherical particles orient as they settle in a flow has important
practical implications in a number of scientific and engineering problems. in a
quiescent fluid, a slowly settling particle orients so that it settles with its
broad side first. this is an effect of the torque due to convective inertia of
the fluid set in motion by the settling particle, which maximises the drag
experienced by the particle. turbulent flows tend to randomise the particle
orientation. recently the settling of non-spherical particles in turbulence was
analysed neglecting the effect of convective fluid inertia, but taking into
account the effect of the turbulent fluid-velocity gradients on the particle
orientation. these studies reached the opposite conclusion, namely that a rod
settles preferentially with its tip first, wheras a disk settles with its edge
first, therefore minimizing the drag on the particle. here, we consider both
effects, the convective inertial torque as well as the torque due to
fluctuating velocity gradients, and ask under which circumstances either one or
the other dominate. to this end we estimate the ratio of the magnitudes of the
two torques. our estimates suggest that the fluid-inertia torque prevails in
high-reynolds number flows. in this case non-spherical particles are expected
to settle with a maximal drag. but when the reynolds number is small then the
torque due to fluid-velocity gradients may dominate, causing the particle to
settle with its broad side first.

"the earth is a rapidly rotating body. the centrifugal pull makes its shape
resemble a flattened ellipsoid and coriolis forces support waves in its fluid
core, known as inertial waves. these waves can lead to global oscillations, or
modes, of the fluid. periodic variations of the earth's rotation axis
(nutations) can lead to an exchange of angular momentum between the mantle and
the fluid core and excite these inertial modes. in addition to viscous torques
that exist regardless of the shape of the boundaries, the small flattening of
the core-mantle boundary (cmb) allows inertial modes to exert pressure torques
on the mantle. these torques effectively couple the rigid-body dynamics of the
earth with the fluid dynamics of the fluid core. here we present the first high
resolution numerical model that solves simultaneously the rigid body dynamics
of the mantle and the navier-stokes equation for the liquid core. this method

mode, mostly a toroidal fluid flow if the mantle has a large moment of inertia,
enters into resonance with nearby modes if the mantle's moment of inertia is

fundamental importance in a range of applications including tsunami and
internal ocean wave modelling. this study is performed in the context of the
viscous fluid conduit system-the driven, cylindrical, free interface between
two miscible stokes fluids with high viscosity contrast. due to buoyancy
induced nonlinear self-steepening balanced by stress induced interfacial
dispersion, the disturbance evolves into a slowly modulated wavetrain and
further, into a sequence of solitary waves. an extension of whitham modulation
theory, termed the solitary wave resolution method, is used to resolve the
fission of an initial disturbance into solitary waves. the developed theory
predicts the relationship between the initial disturbance's profile, the number
of emergent solitary waves, and their amplitude distribution, quantifying an
extension of the well-known soliton resolution conjecture from integrable
systems to non-integrable systems that often provide a more accurate modelling
of physical systems. the theoretical predictions for the fluid conduit system

continuous formulation includes both ""no-slip"" fluid-structure interaction as
well as frictionless contact between multiple elastic bodies. the respective
interface conditions in normal and tangential orientation and especially the
role of the fluid stress within the region of closed contact are discussed for
the general problem of fsci. to ensure continuity of the tangential constraints
from no-slip to frictionless contact, a transition is enabled by using the
general navier condition with varying slip length. moreover, the fluid stress
in the contact zone is obtained by an extension approach as it plays a crucial
role for the lift-off behavior of contacting bodies. with the given continuity
of the spatially continuous formulation, continuity of the discrete problem
(which is essential for the convergence of newton's method) is reached
naturally. as topological changes of the fluid domain are an inherent challenge
in fsci configurations, a non-interface fitted cut finite element method
(cutfem) is applied to discretize the fluid domain. all interface conditions,
that is the `no-slip' fsi, the general navier condition, and frictionless
contact are incorporated using nitsche based methods, thus retaining the
continuity and consistency of the model. to account for the strong interaction
between the fluid and solid discretization, the overall coupled discrete system
is solved monolithically. numerical examples of varying complexity are
presented to corroborate the developments.

"while the realistically modeling of the thermodynamic behavior of fluids
usually demands elaborated atomistic models, much have been learned from
simplified ones. here, we investigate a model where point-like particles (with
activity $z_0$) are mixed with molecules that exclude their first and second
neighbors (i.e., cubes of lateral size $\lambda=\sqrt{3}a$, with activity
$z_2$), both placed on the sites of a simple cubic lattice with parameter $a$.
only hard-core interactions exist among the particles, so that the model is
athermal. despite its simplicity, the grand-canonical solution of this model on
a husimi lattice built with cubes revels a fluid-fluid demixing, yielding a
phase diagram with two fluid phases (one of them dominated by small particles -
$f0$) and a solid-like phase coexisting at a triple-point. moreover, the
fluid-fluid coexistence line ends at a critical point. an anomaly in the total
density ($\rho_t$) of particles is also found, which is hallmarked by minima in
the isobaric curves of $\rho_t$ versus $z_0$ (or $z_2$). interestingly, the
line of minimum density cross the phase diagram starting inside the region
where both fluid phases are stable, passing through the $f0$ one and ending
deep inside its metastable region, in a point where the spinodals of both fluid
phases cross each other.

relation to a uniform slider bearing (i.e., for a constant lubricant film

profile variation along the main flow direction). validations refer to
comparisons with analytical solutions, herein generalized to consider any
dirichlet boundary condition. further, this study allows a first code
validation of the fluid-fixed frontier interactions under no-slip conditions.
with respect to the most state-of-the-art models (2d codes based on reynolds'

(i) 3d formulation on all the terms of the navier-stokes equations for
incompressible fluids with uniform viscosity; (ii) validations on both local
and global quantities (pressure and velocity profiles; load-bearing capacity);
(iii) possibility to simulate any 3d topology. this study also shows the
advantages of using a cfd-sph code in simulating the inertia and 3d effects
close to the slider edges, and it opens new research directions overcoming the
limitations of the codes for hydrodynamic lubrication based on the reynolds'
equation for fluid films. this study finally allows sphera to deal with
hydrodynamic lubrication and empowers the code for other relevant application

"single fluid porous medium systems are typically modeled at an averaged
length scale termed the macroscale using darcy's law. standard approaches for
modeling macroscale single fluid phase flow of non-newtonian fluids extend
darcy's law, using an effective viscosity and assuming that the permeability is
invariant. this approach results in a need to determine the effective viscosity
for every fluid and flow rate. we use the thermodynamically constrained
averaging theory (tcat) to examine the formulation and closure of a macroscale
model for non-newtonian flow that is consistent with microscale conservation
principles and the second law of thermodynamics. a connection between
microscale and macroscale quantities is used to calculate interphase momentum
transfer for non-newtonian flow in porous medium systems. darcy's law is shown
to approximate momentum transfer from the fluid phase to the solid phase. this
momentum transfer is found to depend on the viscosity at the solid surface. as
a consequence of the derived equation for momentum transfer, the commonly
called intrinsic permeability is not invariant for non-newtonian flow, which is
an assumption that underlies standard effective viscosity approaches. tcat is
used to derive a macroscale equation relating the flow rate and the pressure
gradient dependent upon fluid properties and medium characterization, breaking
the need to investigate all flow and composition conditions currently required.
this new approach is validated for model systems and used to interpret results
from the literature, including an evaluation of conditions under which a
transition occurs away from the strictly laminar flow conditions. the results
from this work form a basis for more rigorous and realistic modeling of
non-newtonian flow in porous medium systems.

"painting is a fluid mechanical process. the action of covering a solid
surface with a layer of a viscous fluid is one of the most common human
activities; virtually all man-made surfaces are painted to provide protection
against the environment or simply for decoration. this process, in an
industrial context, has been vastly studied and it is well understood. in case
of artistic painting the purpose is different. painters learn how to manipulate
the non-uniform deposition of paint onto a surface, through lengthy empirical
testing of the action and modifying the physical properties of the fluids, to
create textures and patterns of aesthetic value. in this paper, an analysis of
some notable painting techniques is presented from the point of view of fluid
mechanics. in particular, we discuss the so-called `accidental painting'
technique, originally devised by david a. siqueiros, which is the result of a
rayleigh-taylor instability. an analysis of several techniques used by jackson
pollock is also presented, showing how he learned to carefully control the
motion of viscous filaments to create his famous abstract compositions. we also
briefly discuss how pattern and textures are produced in decalcomania and
watercolor painting. these investigations indicate that it is possible to

"we investigate effective equations governing the volume expansion of
spatially averaged portions of inhomogeneous cosmologies in spacetimes filled
with an arbitrary fluid. this work is a follow-up to previous studies focused
on irrotational dust models (paper i) and irrotational perfect fluids (paper
ii) in flow-orthogonal foliations of spacetime. it complements them by
considering arbitrary foliations, arbitrary lapse and shift, and by allowing
for a tilted fluid flow with vorticity. as for the first studies, the
propagation of the spatial averaging domain is chosen to follow the congruence
of the fluid, which avoids unphysical dependencies in the averaged system that
is obtained. we present two different averaging schemes and corresponding
systems of averaged evolution equations providing generalizations of papers i
and ii. the first one retains the averaging operator used in several other
generalizations found in the literature. we extensively discuss relations to
these formalisms and pinpoint limitations, in particular regarding rest mass
conservation on the averaging domain. the alternative averaging scheme that we
subsequently introduce follows the spirit of papers i and ii and focuses on the
fluid flow and the associated 1+3 threading congruence, used jointly with the
3+1 foliation that builds the surfaces of averaging. this results in compact
averaged equations with a minimal number of cosmological backreaction terms. we
highlight that this system becomes especially transparent when applied to a
natural class of foliations which have constant fluid proper time slices.

"brownian motion occurs in a variety of fluids, from rare gases to liquids.
the langevin equation, describing friction and agitation forces in statistical
balance, is one of the most successful ways to treat the phenomenon. in rare
gases, it is appropriate to model both friction and agitation in terms of
independent molecular impacts with the particle. but in relatively dense
fluids, such as water and air at standard temperature and pressure, the mean
free path between collisions of fluid molecules is much smaller than the size
of the brownian particle, and the friction is normally treated as a mesoscopic
viscous effect described by stokes' law which treats the fluid as continuous.
the appropriateness of using stokes' law will be discussed in terms of recent
experimental research in the ballistic or ""coasting"" phase of motion occurring
at a very short time scale. given the mesoscopic nature of the friction force
for relatively dense fluids, we should expect the agitation force to also be
mesoscopic. but it is often unrealistically modeled as uncorrelated individual
impacts. it has been suggested occasionally that mesoscopic pressure
fluctuations are appropriate for denser fluids. the purpose of this paper is to
model friction as a result of mesoscopic pressure fluctuations. first, the
simple random walk will be used to approximate the time and space scales below
which ballistic motion begins and diffusive motion ends. following that,
pressure fluctuations and the associated time scale will be introduced to
explain brownian motion. as successful as the pressure fluctuation model is for
many fluids, it will be shown to fail for fluids like glycerin that have
viscosities a thousand times and more that of water.

"the phase behavior of hydrocarbon fluids confined in porous media has been
reported to deviate significantly from that in the bulk environment due to the
existence of sub-10nm pores. though experiments and simulations have measured
the bubble/dew points and sorption isotherms of hydrocarbons confined in both
natural and synthetic nanopores, the confinement effects in terms of the
strength of fluid-pore interactions tuned by surface wettability and chemistry
have received comparably less discussion. more importantly, the underlying
physics of confinement-induced phenomena remain obfuscated. in this work, we
studied the phase behavior and capillary condensation of n-hexane to understand
the effects of confinement at the molecular level. to systematically
investigate the pore effects, we constructed two types of wall confinements;
one is a structureless virtual wall described by the steele potential and the
other one is an all-atom amorphous silica structure with surface modified by
hydroxyl groups. our numerical results demonstrated the importance of
fluid-pore interaction, pore size, and pore morphology effects in mediating the
pressure-volume-temperature (pvt) properties of hydrocarbons. the most
remarkable finding of this work was that the saturation pressure predicted from
the van der waals-type adsorption isothermal loop could be elevated or
suppressed relative to the bulk phase, as illustrated in the graphical
abstract. as the surface energy (i.e., fluid-pore interaction) decreased, the
isothermal vapor pressure increased, indicating a greater preference for the
fluid to exist in the vapor state. sufficient reduction of the fluid-pore
interactions could even elevate the vapor pressure above that of the bulk
fluid.

"we investigate freely expanding liquid sheets made of either simple newtonian
fluids or solutions of high molecular water-soluble polymer chains. a sheet is
produced by the impact of a drop on a quartz plate covered with a thin layer of
liquid nitrogen that suppresses shear viscous dissipation thanks to an inverse
leidenfrost effect. the sheet expands radially until reaching a maximum
diameter and subsequently recedes. experiments indicate the presence of two
expansion regimes: the capillary regime, where the maximum expansion is
controlled by surface tension forces and does not depend on the viscosity, and
the viscous regime, where the expansion is reduced with increasing viscosity.
in the viscous regime, the sheet expansion for polymeric samples is strongly
enhanced as compared to that of newtonian samples with comparable zero-shear
viscosity. we show that data for newtonian and non-newtonian fluids collapse on
a unique master curve where the maximum expansion factor is plotted against the
relevant effective biaxial extensional ohnesorge number that depends on fluid
density, surface tension and the biaxial extensional viscosity. for newtonian
fluids, this biaxial extensional viscosity is six times the shear viscosity. by
contrast, for the non- newtonian fluids, a characteristic weissenberg
number-dependent biaxial extensional viscosity is identified, which is in
quantitative agreement with experimental and theoretical results reported in
the literature for biaxial extensional flows of polymeric liquids.

spheres defined on a husimi lattice built with cubes, which provides a

composed by point-like particles (0nn) and particles which exclude up to their
first (1nn) and second neighbors (2nn), with activities $z_0$, $z_1$ and $z_2$,
respectively. our solution reveals a very rich thermodynamic behavior, with two
solid phases associated with the ordering of 1nn ($s1$) or 2nn particles
($s2$), and two fluid phases, being one regular ($rf$) and the other
characterized by a dominance of 0nn particles ($f0$ phase). however, in most
part of the phase diagram these fluid ($f$) phases are indistinguishable.
discontinuous transitions are observed between all the four phases, yielding
several coexistence surfaces in the system, among which a fluid-fluid and a

points and a line of triple points (where the phases $rf$-$f0$-$s2$ coexist),
both meeting at a special point, after which the fluid-fluid coexistence
becomes metastable. another line of triple points is found, connecting the
$f$-$s1$, $f$-$s2$ and $s1$-$s2$ coexistence surfaces. a critical $f$-$s1$

tricritical points. furthermore, a thermodynamic anomaly characterized by

three surfaces of minimal density in the activity space, depending on which

considered to be the primary flow, whereas the linear cross shear flow is a
secondary flow with amplitude $10\%$ of the primary flow. to study the effects
of elasticity and plasticity of the carrying fluid on the sphere drag as well
as the flow dynamics, the fluid is modeled using the elastovisco-plastic (evp)

stress tensor is fully coupled with the flow equation and the solid particle is
represented by an immersed boundary (ib) method. our results show that the
fore-aft asymmetry in the velocity is less pronounced and the negative wake
disappears when a linear cross shear flow is applied. we find that the drag on
a sphere settling in a sheared yield stress fluid is reduced significantly as
compared to an otherwise quiescent fluid. more importantly, the sphere drag in
the presence of a secondary cross shear flow cannot be derived from the pure
sedimentation drag law owing to the non-linear coupling between the simple
shear flow and the uniform flow. finally, we show that the drag on the sphere
settling in a sheared yield-stress fluid is reduced at higher material
elasticity mainly due to the form and viscous drag reduction.

arbitrary number of interferers, from which the multiplexing gain of fama is
characterized. we also estimate how large n is required to achieve a given
multiplexing gain using fluid antennas with a given size. results illustrate
that it is possible for fama to support hundreds of users using only one fluid
antenna at each user in a few wavelengths of space, giving rise to significant

"the asymmetries that arise when a mixing layer involves two miscible fluids
of differing densities are investigated using incompressible (low-speed) direct
numerical simulations. the simulations are performed in the temporal
configuration with very large domain sizes, to allow the mixing layers to reach
prolonged states of fully-turbulent self-similar growth. imposing a mean
density variation breaks the mean symmetry relative to the classical
single-fluid temporal mixing layer problem. unlike prior variable-density
mixing layer simulations in which the streams are composed of the same fluids
with dissimilar thermodynamic properties, the density variations are presently
due to compositional differences between the fluid streams, leading to
different mixing dynamics. variable-density (non-boussinesq) effects introduce
strong asymmetries in the flow statistics that can be explained by the
strongest turbulence increasingly migrating to the lighter fluid side as free
stream density difference increases. interface thickness growth rates also
reduce, with some thickness definitions particularly sensitive to the
corresponding changes in alignment between density and streamwise velocity
profiles. additional asymmetries in the sense of statistical distributions of
densities at a given position within the mixing layer reveal that fine scales
of turbulence are preferentially sustained in lighter fluid, which also is
where fastest mixing occurs. these effects influence statistics involving
density fluctuations, which have important implications for mixing and more

well as local particle identity ordering in the film are affected. furthermore,
we observe flow field induced melting associated with a decrease of effective

  we assume microgravity conditions and neglect the convective transport of
energy and momentum. we derive expressions for the droplet migration speed and
its shape in terms of the properties of both fluids. in the absence of shape
deformation, the droplet speed decreases monotonically for sufficiently viscous
inner fluids, while for fluids with a smaller inner-to-outer viscosity ratio,
the droplet speed first increases and then decreases as a function of the
weissenberg number. for small but finite values of the capillary number, the
droplet speed behaves monotonically as a function of the applied temperature
gradient for a fixed ratio of the capillary and weissenberg numbers. we
demonstrate that this behaviour is related to the polymeric stresses deforming
the droplet in the direction of its migration, while the associated changes in
its speed are newtonian in nature, being related to a change in the droplet's
hydrodynamic resistance and its internal temperature distribution. when

spontaneous formation of vortices and of high density clusters. we suppress the
clustering instability by imposing constraints on the system sizes, in order to
illustrate how lg-equations can be derived for the order parameter, being the
rate of deformation or shear rate tensor, which controls the formation of
vortex patterns. from the shape of the energy functional we obtain the
stationary patterns in the flow field. quantitative predictions of this theory
for the stationary states agree well with molecular dynamics simulations of a

"the helmholtz free energy f of the interacting 2-d electron fluid is
calculated nonperturbatively using a mapping of the quantum fluid to a

"from extensive molecular dynamics simulations on immiscible two-phase flows,
we find the relative slipping between the fluids and the solid wall everywhere
to follow the generalized navier boundary condition, in which the amount of
slipping is proportional to the sum of tangential viscous stress and the
uncompensated young stress. the latter arises from the deviation of the
fluid-fluid interface from its static configuration. we give a continuum
formulation of the immiscible flow hydrodynamics, comprising the generalized
navier boundary condition, the navier-stokes equation, and the cahn-hilliard
interfacial free energy. our hydrodynamic model yields interfacial and velocity
profiles matching those from the molecular dynamics simulations at the

"compared to pure fluids, binary mixtures display a very diverse phase
behavior, which depends sensitively on the parameters of the microscopic
potential. here we investigate the phase diagrams of simple model mixtures by
use of a microscopic implementation of the renormalization group technique.
first, we consider a symmetric mixture with attractive interactions, possibly
relevant for describing fluids of molecules with internal degrees of freedom.
despite the simplicity of the model, slightly tuning the strength of the
interactions between unlike species drastically changes the topology of the
phase boundary, forcing or inhibiting demixing, and brings about several
interesting features such as double critical points, tricritical points, and
coexistence domains enclosing `islands' of homogeneous, mixed fluid.
homogeneous phase separation in mixtures can be driven also by purely repulsive
interactions. as an example, we consider a model of soft particles which has
been adopted to describe binary polymer solutions. this is shown to display
demixing (fluid-fluid) transition at sufficiently high density. the nature and
the physical properties of the corresponding phase transition are investigated.

"we develop a thermodynamic description of particles held at a fixed surface
potential. this system is of particular interest in view of the continuing
controversy over the possibility of a fluid-fluid phase separation in aqueous
colloidal suspensions with monovalent counterions. the condition of fixed
surface potential allows in a natural way to account for the colloidal charge
renormalization. in a first approach, we assess the importance of the so called
``volume terms'', and find that in the absence of salt, charge renormalization
is sufficient to stabilize suspension against a fluid-fluid phase separation.
presence of salt, on the other hand, is found to lead to an instability. a very
strong dependence on the approximations used, however, puts the reality of this
phase transition in a serious doubt. to further understand the nature of the
instability we next study a jellium-like approximation, which does not lead to
a phase separation and produces a relatively accurate analytical equation of
state for a deionized suspensions of highly charged colloidal spheres. a
critical analysis of various theories of strongly asymmetric electrolytes is

of solid colloidal particles suspended in the binary mixture is addressed,
which extends the solid-fluid boundary conditions for mass and momentum to

mixture of repulsive gaussian particles confined in a spherical cavity of
variable size. for this model fluid there exists an extremely simple helmholtz
free energy functional that provides a remarkably accurate description of the
equilibrium fluid properties. we therefore use this functional to test the
assumptions implicit in the dynamical density functional theory, rather than
any approximations involved in constructing the free energy functional. we find
very good agreement between the theory and brownian dynamics simulations,
focusing on cases where the confined fluid exhibits phase separation in the

solutions of coupled algebraic equations, with constants only involving spatial
integrals over various equilibrium thermodynamic derivatives. this variational

both functional forms of the tail-tail attraction and found that a certain
threshold attractive width was required to stabilize the fluid phase. within
the fluid phase region we find that material properties such as area per lipid,
orientational order, diffusion constant, inter-leaflet flip-flop rate and
bilayer stiffness all depend strongly and monotonically on the attractive
width. for three particular values of the potential width we investigate the
transition between gel and fluid phases via heating or cooling and find that
this transition is discontinuous with considerable hysteresis. we also

"from a minimal set made of four scale factors defined at the liquid-gas
critical point of a pure fluid, and one adjustable parameter which accounts for
particle quantum effects, we demonstrate here a master singular behavior of the
correlation length for the one-component fluid subclass, using an asymptotic

of thermo- dynamics, which authorizes specific master form for hyperscaling
within the subclass of pure fluids; (ii) a master constant value of the

demonstrated that the navier-stokes model can be reproduced by the lgca

"the connection is established between two different action principles for
perfect fluids in the context of general relativity. for one of these actions,
$s$, the fluid four--velocity is expressed as a sum of products of scalar
fields and their gradients (the velocity--potential representation). for the
other action, ${\bar s}$, the fluid four--velocity is proportional to the
totally antisymmetric product of gradients of the fluid lagrangian coordinates.
the relationship between $s$ and ${\bar s}$ is established by expressing $s$ in
hamiltonian form and identifying certain canonical coordinates as ignorable.
elimination of these coordinates and their conjugates yields the action ${\bar

"a computational approach is introduced for the study of the rheological
properties of complex fluids and soft materials. the approach allows for a
consistent treatment of microstructure elastic mechanics, hydrodynamic
coupling, thermal fluctuations, and externally driven shear flows. a mixed
description in terms of eulerian and lagrangian reference frames is used for
the physical system. microstructure configurations are represented in a
lagrangian reference frame. conserved quantities, such as momentum of the fluid
and microstructures, are represented in an eulerian reference frame. the
mathematical formalism couples these different descriptions using general
operators subject to consistency conditions. thermal fluctuations are taken
into account in the formalism by stochastic driving fields introduced in
accordance with the principles of statistical mechanics. to study the
rheological responses of materials subject to shear, generalized periodic
boundary conditions are developed where periodic images are shifted relative to
the unit cell to induce shear. stochastic numerical methods are developed for
the formalism. as a demonstration of the methods, results are presented for the
shear responses of a polymeric fluid, lipid vesicle fluid, and a gel-like
material.

"we investigate the flow of various non-newtonian fluids through
three-dimensional disordered porous media by direct numerical simulation of
momentum transport and continuity equations. remarkably, our results for
power-law (pl) fluids indicate that the flow, when quantified in terms of a
properly modified permeability-like index and reynolds number, can be
successfully described by a single (universal) curve over a broad range of
reynolds conditions and power-law exponents. we also study the flow behavior of
bingham fluids described in terms of the herschel-bulkley model. in this case,
our simulations reveal that the interplay of ({\it i}) the disordered geometry
of the pore space, ({\it ii}) the fluid rheological properties, and ({\it iii})
the inertial effects on the flow is responsible for a substantial enhancement
of the macroscopic hydraulic conductance of the system at intermediate reynolds
conditions. this anomalous condition of ``enhanced transport'' represents a
novel feature for flow in porous materials.

"the steady, coaxial flow in which two immiscible, incompressible fluids move
past each other in a cylindrical tube has a continuum of possibilities due to
the arbitrariness of the interface between the fluids. by invoking the presence
of surface tension to at least restrict the shape of any interface to that of a
circular arc or full circle, we consider the following question: which flow
will maximise the exchange when there is only one dividing interface gamma?
surprisingly, the answer differs fundamentally from the better-known
co-directional two-phase flow situation where an axisymmetric (concentric)
core-annular solution always optimises the flux. instead, the maximal flux
state is invariably asymmetric either being a `side-by-side' configuration
where gamma starts and finishes at the tube wall or an eccentric core-annular
flow where gamma is an off-centre full circle in which the more viscous fluid
is surrounded by the less viscous fluid. the side-by-side solution is the most
efficient exchanger for a small viscosity ratio beta less than or equal to 4.60
with an eccentric core-annular solution optimal otherwise. at large beta, this
eccentric solution provides 51% more flux than the axisymmetric core-annular
flow which is always a local minimiser of the flux.

"the geometric nature of euler fluids has been clearly identified and
extensively studied over the years, culminating with lagrangian and hamiltonian
descriptions of fluid dynamics where the configuration space is defined as the
volume-preserving diffeomorphisms, and kelvin's circulation theorem is viewed
as a consequence of noether's theorem associated with the particle relabeling
symmetry of fluid mechanics. however computational approaches to fluid
mechanics have been largely derived from a numerical-analytic point of view,
and are rarely designed with structure preservation in mind, and often suffer
from spurious numerical artifacts such as energy and circulation drift. in
contrast, this paper geometrically derives discrete equations of motion for
fluid dynamics from first principles in a purely eulerian form. our approach
approximates the group of volume-preserving diffeomorphisms using a finite
dimensional lie group, and associated discrete euler equations are derived from
a variational principle with non-holonomic constraints. the resulting discrete
equations of motion yield a structure-preserving time integrator with good
long-term energy behavior and for which an exact discrete kelvin's circulation
theorem holds.

density of the fluid and the anisotropy energy density) are of particular

the first model, the directional eos parameter on the x axis is assumed to be

the light sphere where the flux terminates. we find self-consistent solutions
for the density and the magnetic flux. the details of the solution depend on

shown that the vorticity of the fluid is developed whenever the particle local

their radius is reduced by a factor of 2/sqrt(3). a rough calculation indicates
that at rhic these vortices are indeed smaller than the fireball itself during
thermalization. similarly to the burgers vortex, these solutions manifest
vortex stretching which avoids short distance singularities and so suggests
that conformal fluid flows share the same nonsingularity as solutions of the
navier-stokes equations. naively generalizing this calculation to an arbitrary
equation of state w, we observe that the burgers vortex radius diverges as w
crosses -1. while it has been argued that such a crossover leads to an

therefore vortex stretching suggests that, in addition to the well-studied big

that the ideal bose-einstein condensation fits in this scenario, but that it
also permits the occurrence of a situation that we may call ""fermi-dirac

as a true phase transition. as a corollary, this argument shows the necessity
of the appearance of a ""supersolid"" phase. we also indicate how these ideas may

introduces a mechanism that produces selective decay by enforcing casimir
dissipation in fluid dynamics. this mechanism turns out to be related in
certain cases to the numerical method of anticipated vorticity discussed in

selective decay is developed that uses the lie-poisson structure of the ideal
theory. a scale-selection operator allows the resulting modifications of the

the nonlinear, dynamical interactions between disparate scales. the type of
modified fluid equation systems derived here may be useful in modelling

"we describe the cosmological dynamics of perfect fluids within the framework
of effective field theories. the effective action is a derivative expansion
whose terms are selected by the symmetry requirements on the relevant
long-distance degrees of freedom, which are identified with comoving
coordinates. the perfect fluid is defined by requiring invariance of the action
under internal volume-preserving diffeomorphisms and general covariance. at
lowest order in derivatives, the dynamics is encoded in a single function of
the entropy density that characterizes the properties of the fluid, such as the
equation of state and the speed of sound. this framework allows a neat
simultaneous description of fluid and metric perturbations. longitudinal fluid
perturbations are closely related to the adiabatic modes, while the transverse
modes mix with vector metric perturbations as a consequence of vorticity
conservation. this formalism features a large flexibility which can be of
practical use for higher order perturbation theory and cosmological parameter
estimation.

"the violent giant flares of magnetars excite qpos which persist for hundreds
of seconds, as seen in the x-ray tail following the initial burst. recent
studies, based on single-fluid barotropic magnetar models, have suggested that
the lower-frequency qpos correspond to magneto-elastic oscillations of the
star. the higher frequencies, however, in particular the strong 625 hz peak,
have proved harder to explain, except as high mode multipoles. in this work we
study the time evolutions of non-axisymmetric oscillations of two-fluid
newtonian magnetars with no crust. we consider models with superfluid neutrons
and normal protons, and poloidal and toroidal background field configurations.
we show that multi-fluid physics (composition-gradient stratification,
entrainment) tends to increase alfven mode frequencies significantly from their
values in a single-fluid barotropic model. the higher-frequency magnetar qpos
may then be naturally interpreted as alfven oscillations of the multi-fluid
stellar core. the lower-frequency qpos are less easily explained within our
purely fluid core model, but we discuss the possibility that these are crustal
modes.

set of solutions that are monocromatic plane waves for the fluid density and
two of the potentials and a linear function for the third potential. the

"conditions are investigated under which a body lying at rest or rocking on a
solid horizontal surface can be removed from the surface by hydrodynamic forces
or instead continues rocking. the investigation is motivated by recent
observations on martian dust movement as well as other small- and large-scale
applications. the nonlinear theory of fluid-body interaction here has unsteady
motion of an inviscid fluid interacting with a moving thin body. various shapes
of body are addressed together with a range of initial conditions. the relevant
parameter space is found to be subtle as evolution and shape play substantial
roles coupled with scaled mass and gravity effects. lift-off of the body from
the surface generally cannot occur without fluid flow but it can occur either
immediately or within a finite time once the fluid flow starts up: parameters
for this are found and comparisons are made with martian observations.

"a flexible membrane deforming its shape in time can self-propel in a viscous
fluid. alternatively, if the membrane is anchored, its deformation will lead to
fluid transport. past work in this area focused on situations where the
deformation kinematics of the membrane were prescribed. here we consider models
where the deformation of the membrane is not prescribed, but instead the
membrane is internally forced. both the time-varying membrane shape, and the
resulting fluid motion, result then from a balance between prescribed internal
active stresses, internal passive resistance, and external viscous stresses. we
introduce two specific models for such active internal forcing: one where a
distribution of active bending moments is prescribed, and one where active
inclusions exert normal stresses on the membrane by pumping fluid through it.
in each case, we asymptotically calculate the membrane shape and the fluid
transport velocities for small forcing amplitudes, and recover our results
using scaling analysis.

"the velocity relaxation of an impulsively forced spherical particle in a
fluid confined by two parallel plane walls is studied using a direct numerical
simulation approach. during the relaxation process, the momentum of the
particle is transmitted in the ambient fluid by viscous diffusion and sound
wave propagation, and the fluid flow accompanied by each mechanism has a
different character and affects the particle motion differently. because of the
bounding walls, viscous diffusion is hampered, and the accompanying shear flow
is gradually diminished. however, the sound wave is repeatedly reflected and
spreads diffusely. as a result, the particle motion is governed by the sound
wave and backtracks differently in a bulk fluid. the time when the backtracking
of the particle occurs changes non-monotonically with respect to the
compressibility factor and is minimized at the characteristic compressibility
factor. this factor depends on the wall spacing, and the dependence is
different at small and large wall spacing regions based on the different
mechanisms causing the backtracking.

"we conduct experiments with flexible swimmers to address the impact of fluid
viscoelasticity on their locomotion. the swimmers are composed of a magnetic
head actuated in rotation by a frequency-controlled magnetic field and a
flexible tail whose deformation leads to forward propulsion. we consider both
viscous newtonian and glucose-based boger fluids with similar viscosities. we
find that the elasticity of the fluid systematically enhances the locomotion
speed of the swimmer, and that this enhancement increases with deborah number.
using particle image velocimetry to visualize the flow field, we find a
significant difference in the amount of shear between the rear and leading
parts of the swimmer head. we conjecture that viscoelastic normal stresses lead
to a net elastic forces in the swimming direction and thus a faster swimming
speed.
",fluid elasticity increases the locomotion of flexible swimmers
"by bernoulli's law, an increase in the relative speed of a fluid around a
body is accompanies by a decrease in the pressure. therefore, a rotating body
in a fluid stream experiences a force perpendicular to the motion of the fluid
because of the unequal relative speed of the fluid across its surface. it is
well known that light has a constant speed irrespective of the relative motion.
does a rotating body immersed in a stream of photons experience a
bernoulli-like force? we show that, indeed, a rotating dielectric cylinder
experiences such a lateral force from an electromagnetic wave. in fact, the
sign of the lateral force is the same as that of the fluid-mechanical analogue
as long as the electric susceptibility is positive (\epsilon>\epsilon_{0}), but
for negative-susceptibility materials (e.g. metals) we show that the lateral
force is in the opposite direction. because these results are derived from a
classical electromagnetic scattering problem, mie-resonance enhancements that
occur in other scattering phenomena also enhance the lateral force.

on the interface in a finite time for which the curvature becomes infinite,
while the slope angles remain small. for atwood numbers close to unity in
absolute values, the surface curvature has a definite sign correlated with the
boundary deformation directed towards the light fluid. for fluids with
comparable densities, the curvature changes its sign in a singular point. in

in presence of background electric and magnetic fields. to obtain stress tensor

equation satisfied by the entropy current of the relativistic theory and obtain
a consistent entropy current for the non-relativistic system (we call it

fluid satisfies the second law of thermodynamics we impose constraints on
various first order transport coefficients. for parity even fluid, this is
straight forward; it tells us positive definiteness of different transport
coefficients like viscosity, thermal conductivity, electric conductivity etc.
however for parity-odd fluid, canonical form of the entropy current fails to
confirm the second law of thermodynamics. therefore, we need to add two
parity-odd vectors to the entropy current with arbitrary coefficients. upon
demanding the validity of second law, we see that one can fix these two
coefficients exactly.

response under shear of the suspensions depends on the gas volume fraction and
the bubble stiffness in the suspending fluid. this relative stiffness can be
quantified through capillary numbers comparing the capillary pressure to stress
scales associated with the rheological properties of the suspending fluid. we
demonstrate that those capillary numbers govern the decrease of the elastic and

that the asymptotic early regime is always dominated by the viscosity of the

anomalous behavior observed for water and other anomalous fluids. our findings
show that this system has a superdiffusion regime for sufficient high pressure

regime is strongly related with the fluid structural properties and the
superdiffusion to diffusion transition is a first order phase transition. we
show how the simulation time and statistics are important to obtain the correct
dynamical behavior of the confined fluid. our results are discussed in the

"in the past decade the volvocine green algae, spanning from the unicellular
$chlamydomonas$ to multicellular $volvox$, have emerged as model organisms for
a number of problems in biological fluid dynamics. these include flagellar
propulsion, nutrient uptake by swimming organisms, hydrodynamic interactions
mediated by walls, collective dynamics and transport within suspensions of
microswimmers, the mechanism of phototaxis, and the stochastic dynamics of
flagellar synchronization. green algae are well suited to the study of such
problems because of their range of sizes (from 10 $\mu$m to several
millimetres), their geometric regularity, the ease with which they can be
cultured and the availability of many mutants that allow for connections
between molecular details and organism-level behavior. this review summarizes
these recent developments and highlights promising future directions in the
study of biological fluid dynamics, especially in the context of evolutionary
biology, that can take advantage of these remarkable organisms.

"we introduce an eulerian approach for problems involving one or more soft
solids immersed in a fluid, which permits mechanical interactions between all
phases. the reference map variable is exploited to simulate finite-deformation
constitutive relations in the solid(s) on the same fixed grid as the fluid
phase, which greatly simplifies the coupling between phases. our coupling
procedure, a key contribution in the current work, is shown to be
computationally faster and more stable than an earlier approach, and admits the
ability to simulate both fluid--solid and solid--solid interaction between
submerged bodies. the interface treatment is demonstrated with multiple
examples involving a weakly compressible navier--stokes fluid interacting with
a neo-hookean solid, and we verify the method's convergence. the solid contact
method, which exploits distance-measures already existing on the grid, is
demonstrated with two examples. a new, general routine for cross-interface
extrapolation is introduced and used as part of the new interfacial treatment.

substantially from their bulk density. using a mean-field approach to describe
the energetic landscape near the carbon nanotube (cnt) wall, we obtain
analytical results describing the lengthscales associated with the layering
observed at the fluid-cnt interface. when combined with molecular simulation
results for the fluid density in the layered region, this approach allows us to
derive a closed-form prediction for the overall equilibrium fluid density as a
function of the cnt radius that is in excellent agreement with molecular
dynamics simulations. we also show how aspects of this theory can be extended
to describe water confined within cnts and find good agreement with results
from the literature.

"the displacement of a more viscous fluid by a less viscous one in a quasi-two
dimensional geometry leads to the formation of complex fingering patterns. this
fingering has been characterized by a most unstable wavelength, $\lambda_c$,
which depends on the viscosity difference between the two immiscible fluids and
sets the characteristic width of the fingers. how the finger length grows after
the instability occurs is an equally important, but previously overlooked,
aspect that characterizes the global features of the patterns. as the lower
viscosity fluid is injected, we show that there is a stable inner region where
the outer fluid is completely displaced. the ratio of the finger length to the
radius of this stable region depends only on the viscosity ratio of the fluids
and is decoupled from $\lambda_c$.

"several deterministic and stochastic multi-variable global optimization
algorithms (conjugate gradient, nelder-mead, quasi-newton, and global) are

newtonian, power law, bingham, herschel-bulkley, ellis, ree-eyring and casson.
the results obtained from all those algorithms for all these types of fluid
agree very well with the analytically derived solutions as obtained from the
traditional methods which are based on the conservation principles and fluid

"here we compare two extreme regimes of non-suspended fluid-mediated particle
transport, transport in light and heavy fluids (""saltation"" and ""bedload"",
respectively), regarding their particle fluctuation energy balance. from direct
numerical simulations, we surprisingly find that the ratio between collisional
and fluid drag dissipation of fluctuation energy is significantly larger in
saltation than in bedload, even though the contribution of interparticle
collisions to transport of momentum and energy is much smaller in saltation due
to the low concentration of particles in the transport layer. we conclude that
the much higher frequency of high-energy particle-bed impacts (""splash"") in
saltation is the cause for this counter-intuitive behavior. moreover, from a
comparison of these simulations to particle tracking velocimetry measurements
which we performed in a wind tunnel under steady transport of fine and coarse

"the general properties of a perfect relativistic fluid resulting from the
quantum gravitational anomaly are investigated. it is found that, in the limit
of a weak gravitational field, this fluid possesses a polytropic equation of

natural polytropic index. based on the astrophysical data, the estimates for
the polytropic constant are given. it is shown that this fluid can describe a
considerable part of the cold dark matter. the quantum theory of such a fluid
is constructed in the framework of the background field method. the ward
identities associated with the entropy and vorticity conservation laws are
derived. the leading gradient corrections to the pressure of the perfect fluid
are found and the restrictions on their form are obtained. these restrictions
guarantee, in particular, the absence of ghosts in the model. the second order
nonlinear corrections to the equations of motion of a perfect relativistic

"in collisional fluids, a number of key processes rely on the frequency of
binary collisions. collisions seem necessary to generate a shock wave when two
fluids collide fast enough, to fulfill the rankine-hugoniot relations, to
establish an equation of state or a maxwellian distribution. yet, these
seemingly collisional features are routinely either observed or assumed, in
relation with collision\emph{less} astrophysical plasmas. this article will
review our current answers to the following questions: how do colliding
collisionless plasmas end-up generating a shock as if they were fluids? to
which extent are the rankine-hugoniot relations fulfilled in this case? do
collisionless shocks propagate like fluid ones? can we use an equation of state
to describe collisionless plasmas, like mhd codes for astrophysics do? why are
maxwellian distributions ubiquitous in particle-in-cell simulations of
collisionless shocks? time and length scales defining the border between the
collisional and the collisionless behavior will be given when relevant. in

is based on the deviation of the contact angle from a 90{\deg}-value. by
testing the model against experimental and numerical data from the literature,
good agreement is found within the entire range of contact angles below

side length of the square). the exact equation of state and the nearest
neighbour distribution functions show three different structures: a fluid phase
with one layer, a fluid phase with two layers and a solid-like structure where
the fluid layers are strongly correlated. the structural transition between
differently ordered fluids develops continuously with increasing density, i.e.
no thermodynamic phase transition occurs. the high density structure of the

"recent theoretical and experimental investigations have demonstrated the role
of certain invariant manifolds, termed burning invariant manifolds (bims), as
one-way dynamical barriers to reaction fronts propagating within a flowing
fluid. these barriers form one-dimensional curves in a two-dimensional fluid

time-independent or time-periodic. in the present study, we develop an approach
to identify prominent one-way barriers based only on fluid velocity data over a

fluid and the structure are fully coupled via interface conditions prescribing
the continuity of the velocities at the fluid-structure interface and the

"we consider the time evolution of a dilute atomic fermi gas after release
from a trapping potential. a common difficulty with using fluid dynamics to
study the expansion of the gas is that the theory is not applicable in the
dilute corona, and that a naive treatment of the entire cloud using fluid

including certain non-hydrodynamic degrees of freedom, in particular
anisotropic components of the pressure tensor, in the theoretical description.
we show that, using this method, it is possible to describe the crossover from
fluid dynamics to ballistic expansion locally. we illustrate the use of
anisotropic fluid dynamics by studying the expansion of the dilute fermi gas at
unitarity using different functional forms of the shear viscosity, including a
shear viscosity which is solely a function of temperature, $\eta\sim

relativistic anomaly inflow mechanism with an appropriately modified anomaly
polynomial, can be used to generate these anomalies. similar to relativistic

further, these anomalies only effect the gauge and rotational symmetries of a

phenomenon experimentally using a disc which is started exactly at the
interface of two immiscible fluids, namely oil and water. first, we observe
that due to the density difference between the two fluids the deformation of
the interface is influenced by gravity, and show that there exits a time window
of universal behavior. secondly, we show by comparing with boundary integral
simulations that, even though the deformation is universal, our results cannot
be fully explained by potential flow solutions. we attribute this difference to
the starting vortex, which is created in the wake of the disc. universal
behavior is preserved, however, because the size and strength of the vortex
shows the same universality as the potential flow solution.

"in an effort to study the stability of contact lines in fluids, we consider
the dynamics of an incompressible viscous stokes fluid evolving in a
two-dimensional open-top vessel under the influence of gravity. this is a free
boundary problem: the interface between the fluid in the vessel and the air
above (modeled by a trivial fluid) is free to move and experiences capillary
forces. the three-phase interface where the fluid, air, and solid vessel wall
meet is known as a contact point, and the angle formed between the free
interface and the vessel is called the contact angle. we consider a model of
this problem that allows for fully dynamic contact points and angles. we
develop a scheme of a priori estimates for the model, which then allow us to
show that for initial data sufficiently close to equilibrium, the model admits
global solutions that decay to equilibrium exponentially fast.

cone-plane experimental apparatus which enables measurement of $\dot{\gamma_c}$
over a wide range of particle reynolds number $re_p$ from $10^{-3}$ to $1.5

with the torque balance condition, which { yields a lower $\dot{\gamma_c}$

the particle center. the data for $re_p < 0.5$ is in good agreement with
analytical calculations of the drag and lift coefficients in the $re_p
\rightarrow 0$ limit. for higher $re_p$, where analytical results are
unavailable, the hydrodynamic coefficients are found to approach a constant for
$re_p > 1000$. we show that a linear combination of the hydrodynamic

"this study is an introduction to the theory of three-dimensional
consolidation. the point of departure in the description are the basic
equations of elasticity (i.e. constitutive law, equations of equilibrium in
terms of stresses, and the definition of strain), together with the principle
of effective stress, and the law of darcy for fluid flow in porous media. these
equations, together with the principle of mass conservation, are the only
premises used to derive a drained description of consolidation theory. next,
the increment of fluid content is defined and its constitutive law is derived -
with its derivation following naturally from the equation of fluid mass
balance. pore pressure, storage, and undrained coefficients are also introduced
and useful relations are proven. where appropriate, the physical meaning of
these coefficients is proven mathematically. equations of equilibrium and fluid
mass conservation are subsequently expressed in terms of the increment of fluid
content and undrained coefficients, leading to an undrained description of
consolidation theory. thus the initial approach of using drained description is
extended to the formalism of rice and cleary. this approach to
three-dimensional consolidation is useful for its simplicity. it does not
require the ad-hoc definition of constants and that of an elastic energy
potential. instead, it is a direct extension to linear elasticity that accounts

numbers of a hundred to a thousand in the linear and nonlinear regimes. the two
fluids have the same density but different viscosities. the fluids, when
miscible, are separated from each other by a mixed layer of small but finite
thickness, across which viscosity changes from that of one fluid to that of the

schmidt numbers, viscosity ratios and location and thickness of the mixed
layer. a region of instability distinct from that of the tollmien-schlichting
mode is obtained at moderate reynolds numbers. we show that the overlap of the
layer of viscosity-stratification with the critical layer of the dominant
disturbance provides a mechanism for this instability. at very low values of
diffusivity, the miscible flow behaves exactly like the immiscible in terms of
stability characteristics. high levels of miscibility make the flow more

velocity at the position of a particle is determined by interpolation, such
that a stokes friction force gives rise to an exchange of momentum between the
particle and the surrounding fluid nodes. for efficiency reasons, the lb time
step is chosen as a multiple of the md time step, such that the md system is
updated more frequently than the lb fluid. in this situation, there are
different ways to implement the coupling: either the fluid velocity at the
surrounding nodes is only updated every lb time step, or it is updated every md
step. it is demonstrated that the latter choice, which enforces momentum
conservation on a significantly shorter time scale, is clearly superior in
terms of stability and accuracy, and nevertheless only marginally slower in

"propulsion through fluids is a key component in the life cycle of many
microbes, be it in development, infection, or simply finding nutrients. in
systems of biomedical relevance, this propulsion is often through polymer
suspensions that endow the fluid with complex non-newtonian properties, such as
shear-thinning and viscoelastic behaviour. due to the complexity of 3d
non-newtonian modelling, 2d undulatory propulsion has recently been
extensively-studied as a means of garnering physical intuition for these
systems. however, while streamlines, swimming speeds, and swimmer trajectories
are strikingly similar in 2d and 3d newtonian calculations, behaviour in
non-newtonian fluids depends upon flow derivatives, such as the shear rate,
which are radically different. taking shear-thinning as an example rheology,
prevalent in biological fluids such as physiological mucus, this communication
demonstrates how failing to account for this difference can misguide our
understanding of 3d non-newtonian swimming.

"we consider the evolution of the gravitational wave spectrum for super-hubble
modes in interaction with a relativistic fluid, which is regarded as an
effective description of fluctuations in a light scalar minimally coupled
field, during the earliest epoch of the radiation dominated era after the end
of inflation. we obtain the initial conditions for gravitons and fluid from
quantum fluctuations at the end of inflation, and assume instantaneous
reheating. we model the fluid by using relativistic causal hydrodynamics. there
are two dimensionful parameters, the relaxation time $\tau$ and temperature. in
particular we study the interaction between gravitational waves and the non
trivial tensor (spin 2) part of the fluid energy-momentum tensor. our main
result is that the new dimensionful parameter $\tau$ introduces a new relevant
scale which distinguishes two kinds of super-hubble modes. for modes with
$h^{-1}<\lambda<\tau$ the fluid-graviton interaction increases the amplitude of
the primordial gravitational wave spectrum at the electroweak transition by a
factor of about $1.3$ with respect to the usual scale invariant spectrum.

for the solution of incompressible fsi problems. a main focus of this work is
on the use of geometric multigrid preconditioners with modified richardson

the subdomains in the schwarz smoother is driven by the natural splitting
between fluid and solid. the monolithic approach guarantees the automatic
satisfaction of the stress balance and the kinematic conditions across the
fluid-solid interface. the enforcement of the incompressibility conditions both
for the fluid and for the solid parts is taken care of by using inf-sup stable
finite element pairs without stabilization terms. a suitable arbitrary

"relativistic fluids are lorentz invariant, and a non-relativistic limit of
such fluids leads to the well-known navier-stokes equation. however, for fluids
moving with respect to a reference system, or in critical systems with generic
dynamical exponent z, the assumption of lorentz invariance (or its
non-relativistic version) does not hold. we are thus led to consider the most
general fluid assuming only homogeneity and isotropy and study its
hydrodynamics and transport behaviour. remarkably, such systems have not been
treated in full generality in the literature so far. here we study these

sound, corrections to the navier-stokes equation and determine all dissipative
and non-dissipative first order transport coefficients. dispersion relations
for the sound, shear and diffusion modes are determined to second order in

among ternary fluids and solid is proposed in the framework of the lattice

the particle exchange between the fluid layers; at high levels of shear, the
global slip occurs and is related to the homogeneous distribution of the fluid

to both. it therefore matters how efficiently the fluid disturbance is
convected away from the particle by fluid-inertial terms. when these terms
dominate, the oseen drag force must be recovered. we compute by perturbation
theory how the oseen drag is modified by diffusion and stratification. our

generated directly by the surface distortions and the flow generated by the
mean reynolds force density. depending on the stroke, this can lead to a
surprising dependence of the mean swimming velocity on the kinematic viscosity
of the fluid. the net flow pattern is calculated as a function of kinematic
viscosity for axisymmetric strokes of the swimming sphere. the calculation
covers the full range of scale number, from the friction-dominated stokes
regime in the limit of vanishing scale number to the inertia-dominated regime
at large scale number. the model therefore provides paradigmatic insight into

formation of interfacial structure in the thin dimension spanning the gap. here
we study the effect of the inherent diffusion between the two miscible fluids
on this structure and on the viscous fingering patterns that emerge. we
discover an unexpected transition separating two distinct regimes where the

formalism, reveal that the capillary filling dynamics and the contact line
motion are strong functions of the wetting characteristics and geometric
parameters of the patterned ribs. modulation of these parameters alters the
surface energy over the rib surface, which, in turn, facilitates the
interaction between interfacial tension and driving electrothermal forces. the
competition between two forces may speed up or slow down the fluid-fluid-solid

of use, as the solid and fluid are discretized on the same fixed grid, which
greatly simplifies the coupling between the phases. we use the method to study
a number of illustrative examples involving an incompressible navier-stokes
fluid interacting with multiple neo-hookean solids. our method has several
useful features including the ability to model solids with sharp corners and
the ability to model actuated solids. the latter permits the simulation of
active media such as swimmers, which we demonstrate. the method is validated
favorably in the flag-flapping geometry, for which a number of experimental,
numerical, and analytical studies have been performed. we extend the flapping
analysis beyond the thin-flag limit, revealing an additional destabilization
mechanism to induce flapping.

equations of two-fluid mhd to a symmetric form which looks like the classical
mhd system written in the nonconservative form in terms of the pressure, the

results. in particular, we conclude that all compressive extreme shock waves
exist locally in time in the limit of weak magnetic field. we write down a
condition sufficient for the local-in-time existence of current-vortex sheets
in two-fluid flows. for the 2d case and a particular equation of state, we make
the conclusion that contact discontinuities in two-fluid mhd flows exist
locally in time provided that the rayleigh-taylor sign condition on the jump of

nonequilibrium simulations (rnes). in cubic periodic simulation boxes, the
expected shear flow profile for a newtonian fluid developed, consistent with
the fluid viscosities. however, unexpected secondary flows along the shear
gradient formed when the simulation box was elongated in the flow direction.
the standard shear flow profile was obtained when the simulation box was longer
in the shear-gradient dimension than the flow dimension, while the secondary
flows were always present when the flow dimension was at least 25% larger than
the shear-gradient dimension. the secondary flows satisfy the boundary
conditions imposed by the rnes and have a lower rate of viscous dissipation in
the fluid than the corresponding unidirectional flows. this work highlights a
previously unappreciated limitation of rnes for generating shear flow in
simulation boxes that are elongated in the flow dimension, an important
consideration when applying rnes to complex fluids like polymer solutions.

controlled by a single nonlinear differential equation involving the particle
creation rate, $\gamma (t)$. we consider a very general particle creation rate,
$\gamma (t)$, that reduces to several special cases of cosmological interest,
including $\gamma =$ constant, $% \gamma \propto 1/h^{n}$ ($n\in \mathbb{n}$),
$\gamma \propto \exp (1/h)$. finally, we present singular algebraic solutions

below $w/h \sim 2.6$, the simulations provide evidence of a smooth topological
transition of the fluid from the confined rectangular channel geometry to an
isotropic (spherical) expansion of the fluid downstream the nozzle step. above
such threshold, the transition from the inner to the outer space involves a
series of dynamical rearrangements which keep the free surface in mechanical

in turn, leads to jet pinching and ultimately to its rupture, namely droplet

of fluid, and a spherical fluid droplet. the active fluid is modeled by the
hydrodynamic theory of an active nematic liquid crystal in the isotropic phase.
in each geometry, we calculate the growth rate of sinusoidal modes of
deformation of the interface. there are two distinct branches of growth rates;
at long wavelength, one corresponds to the deformation of the interface, and
one corresponds to the evolution of the liquid crystalline degrees of freedom.
the passive cases of the film and the spherical droplet are always stable. for
these geometries, a sufficiently large activity leads to instability. activity
also leads to propagating damped or growing modes. the passive cylindrical

"the injection of a fluid into a material causes a spatiotemporal pattern to
form along the injection front. this process is relevant in the case of oil
recovery from soil. when the replaced material is a viscous fluid, it forms a
finger-like pattern, known as viscous fingering. interestingly, most replaced
materials are, in reality, viscoelastic, i.e., they behave as an elastic solid
over short timescales but flow as a viscous liquid over longer timescales.
therefore, it is important to study the scenario in which the replaced material
is a viscoelastic fluid. in this study, we observe the appearance of
delamination-induced fingering when an incompressible organic fluid is injected
into an oleophilic hele--shaw cell filled with an aqueous viscoelastic fluid
composed of a wormlike micellar solution. we find a transition in the injection
pattern: during the injection, the thick fingering pattern of the interface
near the inlet changes to thin fingers with a characteristic size of four times
the cell thickness. we examine the material properties, and conclude that the
fingering pattern observed at later times is caused by the delamination of
viscoelastic fluid from the substrate.

from the electrical resistance which saturates to a finite value at low

a soft gap at the center of each vortex, which arises from large zero point

"we formulate a model for the dynamic growth of a membrane developing in a
flow as the result of a precipitation reaction, a situation inspired by recent
microfluidic experiments. the precipitating solid introduces additional forces
on the fluid and eventually forms a membrane that is fixed in the flow due to
adhesion with a substrate. a key challenge is that the location of the immobile
membrane is unknown $\textit{a priori}$. to model this situation, we use a
multiphase framework with fluid and membrane phases; the aqueous chemicals
exist as scalar fields that react within the fluid to induce phase change. to
verify that the model exhibits desired fluid-structure behaviors, we make a few
simplifying assumptions to obtain a reduced form of the equations that is
amenable to exact solution. this analysis demonstrates no-slip behavior on the
developing membrane without $\textit{a priori}$ assumptions on its location.
the model has applications towards precipitate reactions where the precipitate
greatly affects the surrounding flow, a situation appearing in many laboratory

"joint physically and chemically pattered surfaces can provide efficient and
passive manipulation of fluid flow. the ability of many of these surfaces to
allow only unidirectional flow mean they are often referred to as fluid diodes.
synthetic analogues of these are enabling technologies from sustainable water

geometry features a pore sandwiched between two absorbent substrates, an
important design for applications which require liquid capture while preventing
back-flow. however, the enclosed pore is particularly challenging to design as
an effective fluid diode, due to the need for both a low laplace pressure for
liquid entering the pore, and a high laplace pressure to liquid leaving. here,
we calculate the laplace pressure for fluid travelling in both directions on a
range of conical pore designs with a chemical gradient. we show that this
chemical gradient is in general required to achieve the largest critical
pressure differences between incoming and outgoing liquids. finally, we discuss
the optimisation strategy to maximise this critical pressure asymmetry.

involves the dynamics of a conducting droplet, which is immersed in another
dielectric fluid, on a dielectric substrate under an applied voltage. the fluid
dynamics is modeled by the two-phase incompressible navier-stokes equations
with the standard interface conditions, the navier slip condition on the
substrate, and a contact angle condition which relates the dynamic contact
angle and the contact line velocity, as well as the kinematic condition for the
evolution of the interface. the electric force acting on the fluid interface is
modeled by maxwell's equations in the domain occupied by the dielectric fluid
and the dielectric substrate. we develop a numerical method for the model based
on its weak form. this method combines the finite element method for the
navier-stokes equations on a fixed bulk mesh with a parametric finite element
method for the dynamics of the fluid interface, and the boundary integral
method for the electric force along the fluid interface. numerical examples are

"although density functional theory provides reliable predictions for the
static properties of simple fluids under confinement, a theory of comparative
accuracy for the transport coefficients has yet to emerge. nonetheless, there
is evidence that knowledge of how confinement modifies static behavior can aid
in forecasting dynamics. specifically, molecular simulation studies have shown
that the relationship between excess entropy and self diffusivity of a bulk
equilibrium fluid changes only modestly when the fluid is isothermally
confined, indicating that knowledge of the former might allow semi-quantitative
predictions of the latter. do other static measures, such as those that
characterize free or available volume, also strongly correlate with
single-particle dynamics of confined fluids? here, we study this issue for both
the single-component hard-sphere fluid and hard-sphere mixtures. specifically,
we use molecular simulations and fundamental measure theory to study these
systems at approximately $10^3$ equilibrium state points. we examine three
different confining geometries (slit pore, square channel, and cylindrical
pore) and the effects of packing fraction and particle-boundary interactions.
although density fails to predict some key qualitative trends for the dynamics
of confined fluids, we find that a new generalized measure of available volume
for inhomogeneous fluids strongly correlates with the self diffusivity across a
wide parameter space in these systems, approximately independent of the degree
of confinement. an important consequence, which we demonstrate here, is that
density functional theory predictions of this static property can be used
together with knowledge of bulk fluid behavior to estimate the diffusion
coefficient of confined fluids under equilibrium conditions.

"it is known that there are thermodynamic states for which the gaussian-core
(gc) fluid displays anomalous properties such as expansion upon isobaric
cooling (density anomaly) and increased single-particle mobility upon
isothermal compression (self-diffusivity anomaly). we investigate how
temperature and density affect its short-range translational structural order,
as characterized by the two-body excess entropy. we find that there is a wide
range of conditions for which the short-range translational order of the gc
fluid decreases upon isothermal compression (structural order anomaly). the
origin of the structural anomaly is qualitatively similar to that of other
anomalous fluids and is connected to how compression affects static
correlations at different length scales. we find that the self-diffusivity of
the gc fluid obeys a scaling relationship with the two-body excess entropy that
is very similar to the one observed for a variety of simple liquids. one
consequence of this relationship is that the state points for which structural,
self-diffusivity, and density anomalies of the gaussian-core fluid occur appear
as cascading regions on the temperature-density plane, a phenomenon observed
earlier for models of waterlike fluids. there are, however, key differences
between the anomalies of gc and waterlike fluids, and we discuss how those can
be qualitatively understood by considering the respective interparticle
potentials of these models. finally, we note that the self-diffusivity of the
gaussian-core fluid obeys different scaling laws depending on whether the
two-body or total excess entropy is considered. this finding, which deserves
more comprehensive future study, appears to underscore the significance of
higher-body correlations for the behavior of fluids with bounded interactions.

"in this paper, we propose a first order action functional for a large class
of systems that generalize the relativistic perfect fluids in the k\""{a}hler
parametrization to noncommutative spacetimes. we calculate the equations of
motion for the fluid potentials and the energy-momentum tensor in the first
order in the noncommutative parameter. the density current does not receive any
noncommutative corrections and it is conserved under the action of the
commutative generators $p_{\mu}$ but the energy-momentum tensor is not.
therefore, we determine the set of constraints under which the energy-momentum
tensor is divergenceless. another set of constraints on the fluid potentials is
obtained from the requirement of the invariance of the action under the
generalization of the volume preserving transformations of the noncommutative
spacetime. we show that the proposed action describes noncommutative fluid
models by casting the energy-momentum tensor in the familiar fluid form and
identifying the corresponding energy and momentum densities. in the commutative
limit, they are identical to the corresponding quantities of the relativistic
perfect fluids. the energy-momentum tensor contains a dissipative term that is
due to the noncommutative spacetime and vanishes in the commutative limit.
finally, we particularize the theory to the case when the complex fluid
potentials are characterized by a function $k(z,\bar{z})$ that is a deformation
of the complex plane and show that this model has important common features
with the commutative fluid such as infinitely many conserved currents and a
conserved axial current that in the commutative case is associated to the

"the navier-stokes equations are the governing equations of fluid flows. they
are deemed to embody all physics in a flow of newtonian fluids like water,
especially when we assume the fluid is incompressible. fluid flows are usually
described in the eulerian perspective wherein we focus on the fluid's
quantities at a fixed point in space as time processes, rather than the motion
of each individual particle. the latter perspective is indeed the lagrangian
perspective which is widely used in solid mechanics like elasticity. thus, the
navier-stokes equations should be and indeed they are always used in the
eulerian perspective. here we show the right-hand sides of the navier-stokes
equations were derived not in the eulerian perspective but rather in the
lagrangian perspective, because the strain rates used in the derivation were
the lagrangian cauchy strain rates. thus, for describing fluid flows in the
eulerian perspective, the navier-stokes equations may lost some physics. to
make it sure, we put the cauchy strain into the material derivative, and then
derive the eulerian cauchy strain rates. we find the difference between the
eulerian and the lagrangian cauchy strain rates is significant when in a
turbulent flow. therefore, on the basis of the eulerian cauchy strain rates, we
derive a new set of governing equations for the flow of newtonian fluids. the
newly derived governing equations are fully in the eulerian perspective. we

"""fluid polyamorphism"" is the existence of different condensed amorphous
states in a single-component fluid. it is either found or predicted, usually at
extreme conditions, for a broad group of very different substances, including
helium, carbon, silicon, phosphorous, sulfur,tellurium, cerium, hydrogen and
tin tetraiodide. this phenomenon is also hypothesized for metastable and deeply
supercooled water, presumably located a few degrees below the experimental
limit of homogeneous ice formation. we present a generic phenomenological
approach to describe polyamorphism in a single-component fluid, which is
completely independent of the molecular origin of the phenomenon. we show that
fluid polyamorphism may occur either in the presence or the absence of fluid
phase separation depending on the symmetry of the order parameter. in the
latter case, it is associated with a second-order transition, such as in liquid
helium or liquid sulfur. to specify the phenomenology, we consider a fluid with
thermodynamic equilibrium between two distinct interconvertible states or
molecular structures. a fundamental signature of this concept is the
identification of the equilibrium fraction of molecules involved in each of
these alternative states. however, the existence of the alternative structures
may result in polyamorphic fluid phase separation only if mixing of these
structures is not ideal. the two-state thermodynamics unifies all the debated
scenarios of fluid polyamorphism in different areas of condensed-matter
physics, with or without phase separation, and even goes beyond the phenomenon
of polyamorphism by generically describing the anomalous properties of fluids
exhibiting interconversion of alternative molecular states.

"we study the dynamical regimes of a density-stratified fluid confined between
isothermal no-slip top and bottom boundaries (at temperatures $t_t$ and $t_b$)
via direct numerical simulation. the thermal expansion coefficient of the fluid
is temperature dependent and chosen such that the fluid density is maximum at
the inversion temperature $t_b>t_i>t_t$. thus, the lower layer of the fluid is
convectively unstable while the upper layer is stably stratified. we show that
the characteristics of the convection change significantly depending on the
degree of stratification of the stable layer. for strong stable stratification,
the convection zone coincides with the fraction of the fluid that is
convectively unstable (i.e. where $t>t_i$), and convective motions consist of
rising and sinking plumes of large density anomaly, as is the case in canonical
rayleigh-benard convection; internal gravity waves are generated by turbulent
fluctuations in the convective layer and propagate in the upper layer. for weak
stable stratification, we demonstrate that a large fraction of the stable fluid
(i.e. with temperature $t<t_i$) is instead destabilized and entrained by
buoyant plumes emitted from the bottom boundary. the convection thus mixes cold
patches of low density-anomaly fluid with hot upward plumes, and the end result
is that the $t_i$ isotherm sinks within the bottom boundary layer and that the
convection is entrainment-dominated. we provide a phenomenological description
of the transition between the regimes of plume-dominated and
entrainment-dominated convection through analysis of quantities for different
stratification strengths. we find that the effect of the stable layer on the
convection decreases only weakly with increasing stratification strength,
meaning that the dynamics of the stable layer and convection should be studied
self-consistently in a wide range of applications.

approximation of the mixture layer is improved including normal variations of
the velocities and concentrations of the two phases thanks to the multilayer
approach. in the model presented here dilatancy effects induce in particular a
non-hydrostatic pressure for both phases related to the excess pore fluid

with a speed close to the alfven speed. we show that the presence of a random
magnetic field component substantially enhances the reconnection rate and
enables fast reconnection, i.e. reconnection that does not depend on fluid
resistivity. the enhancement of the reconnection rate is achieved via a
combination of two effects. first of all, only small segments of magnetic field
lines are subject to direct ohmic annihilation. thus the fraction of magnetic
energy that goes directly into fluid heating goes to zero as fluid resistivity
vanishes. however, the most important enhancement comes from the fact that
unlike the laminar fluid case where reconnection is constrained to proceed line
by line, the presence of turbulence enables many magnetic field lines to enter
the reconnection zone simultaneously. a significant fraction of magnetic energy
goes into mhd turbulence and this enhances reconnection rates through an
increase in the field stochasticity. in this way magnetic reconnection becomes
fast when field stochasticity is accounted for. as a consequence solar and

show here that the collisional anisotropies are responsible for the normal
stress behaviour in the {\it dense} limit. as in the elastic hard-sphere
fluids, ${\mathcal n}_1$ remains {\it positive} (if the stress is defined in
the {\it compressive} sense) for dilute and moderately dense flows, but becomes
{\it negative} above a critical density, depending on the restitution
coefficient. this sign-reversal of ${\mathcal n}_1$ occurs due to the {\it
microstructural} reorganization of the particles, which can be correlated with
a preferred value of the {\it average} collision angle $\theta_{av}=\pi/4 \pm
\pi/2$ in the direction opposing the shear. we also report on the shear-induced
{\it crystal}-formation, signalling the onset of fluid-solid coexistence in
dense granular fluids. different approaches to take into account the normal
stress differences are discussed in the framework of the relaxation-type
rheological models.

"it is well known that the poiseuille flow of a visco-elastic polymer fluid
between plates or through a tube is linearly stable in the zero reynolds number
limit, although the stability is weak for large weissenberg numbers. in this
paper we argue that recent experimental and theoretical work on the instability
of visco-elastic fluids in taylor-couette cells and numerical work on channel
flows suggest a scenario in which poiseuille flow of visco-elastic polymer
fluids exhibits a nonlinear ""subcritical"" instability due to normal stress
effects, with a threshold which decreases for increasing weissenberg number.
this proposal is confirmed by an explicit weakly nonlinear stability analysis
for poiseuille flow of an ucm fluid. our analysis yields explicit predictions
for the critical amplitude of velocity perturbations beyond which the flow is
nonlinearly unstable, and for the wavelength of the mode whose critical
amplitude is smallest. the nonlinear instability sets in quite abruptly at
weissenberg numbers around 4 in the planar case and about 5.2 in the
cylindrical case, so that for weissenberg numbers somewhat larger than these
values perturbations of the order of a few percent in the wall shear stress
suffice to make the flow unstable. we have suggested elsewhere that this
nonlinear instability could be an important intrinsic route to melt fracture
and that preliminary experiments are both qualitatively and quantitatively in
good agreement with these predictions.

"we describe some scaling issues that arise when using lattice boltzmann
methods to simulate binary fluid mixtures -- both in the presence and in the
absence of colloidal particles. two types of scaling problem arise: physical
and computational. physical scaling concerns how to relate simulation
parameters to those of the real world. to do this effectively requires careful
physics, because (in common with other methods) lattice boltzmann cannot fully
resolve the hierarchy of length, energy and time scales that arise in typical
flows of complex fluids. care is needed in deciding what physics to resolve and
what to leave unresolved, particularly when colloidal particles are present in
one or both of two fluid phases. this influences steering of simulation
parameters such as fluid viscosity and interfacial tension. when the physics is
anisotropic (for example, in systems under shear) careful adaptation of the
geometry of the simulation box may be needed; an example of this, relating to
our study of the effect of colloidal particles on the rayleigh-plateau
instability of a fluid cylinder, is described. the second and closely related
set of scaling issues are computational in nature: how do you scale up
simulations to very large lattice sizes? the problem is acute for systems
undergoing shear flow. here one requires a set of blockwise co-moving frames to
the fluid, each connected to the next by a lees-edwards like boundary
condition. these matching planes lead to small numerical errors whose
cumulative effects can become severe; strategies for minimising such effects
are discussed.

"in this talk r-form fields in spacetimes of any dimension d are considered
(r<d). the weak-field newtonian-type limit of einstein's equations, in general,
with relativistic sources is studied in the static case yielding a revision of
the equivalence principle (intrinsically relativistic sources generate twice
stronger gravitational fields and hyperrelativistic sources, e.g., the stiff
matter, generate four times stronger fields than non-relativistic sources). it
is shown that analogues of electromagnetic field, strictly speaking, exist only
in even-dimensional spacetimes. in (2+1)-dimensional spacetime, the field
traditionally interpreted as ""magnetic"" turns out to be in fact a perfect
fluid, and ""electric"", a perverse fluid (this latter concept arises inevitably
in the r-form description of fluids for any d, and we consider here perverse
fluids in (3+1)-dimensional spacetime too). new exact solutions of
(2+1)-dimensional einstein's equations with perfect and perverse fluids are
obtained, and it is shown that in this case there exists a vast family of
static solutions for non-coherent dust, in a sharp contrast to the
(3+1)-dimensional case. new general interpretation of the cosmological term in
d-dimensional einstein's equations is given via the (d-1)-form field, and it is
shown that this field is as well responsible (as this is the case in 3+1
dimensions) for rotation of perfect fluids [(d-2)-form fields], thus the
""source"" term in the corresponding field equations has to be interpreted as the
rotation term.

d$p$-brane coupled to the gauge field $a_\mu$. in the vacuum with vanishing

matter, survive the tachyon condensation. we offer general analysis of the
associated hamiltonian dynamics in arbitrary background. the canonical field
equations are organized into two sets, fluid equations of motion augmented by
an integrability condition. we show that a large class of motionless and

tachyon condensation, topological defect at t=0 is shown to attract nearby and
parallel flux lines. the final state is fundamental strings absorbed and spread
in some singular d$(p-1)$ brane soliton. when string fluid is transverse to the
domain wall, the latter is known to turn into a smooth solution. we point out
that a minimal solution of this sort exists and saturates a bps energy bound of

"in steady-state non-isentropic flows of perfect fluids there is always
thermodynamic generation of vorticity when the difference between the product
of the temperature with the gradient of the entropy and the gradient of total
enthalpy is different from zero. we note that this property does not hold in
general for complex fluids for which the prominent influence of the material
substructure on the gross motion may cancel the thermodynamic vorticity. we
indicate the explicit condition for this cancellation (topological transition
from vortex sheet to shear flow) for general complex fluids described by
coarse-grained order parameters and extended forms of ginzburg-landau energies.
as a prominent sample case we treat first korteweg's fluid, used commonly as a
model of capillary motion or phase transitions characterized by diffused
interfaces. then we discuss general complex fluids. we show also that, when the
entropy and the total enthalpy are constant throughout the flow, vorticity may
be generated by the inhomogeneous character of the distribution of material
substructures, and indicate the explicit condition for such a generation. we
discuss also some aspects of unsteady motion and show that in two-dimensional
flows of incompressible perfect complex fluids the vorticity is in general not
conserved, due to a mechanism of transfer of energy between different levels.

"the present work discusses about a possible physical interpretation of the
occurrence of turbulence in a dynamic fluid with mathematical modeling and
computer simulation. here turbulence is defined to be a phenomenon of random
velocity field in the space-time continuum accompanied by chaotic occurrence of
vortices. this interpretation is independent of the navier-stokes equations. i
have reasoned how individual fluid percels are disintegrated with increasing
reynolds number (re) (or increasing velocity or decreasing viscosity or both)
leading to creation of smaller parcels with arbitrary speeds in arbitrary
directions, which destroys the laminar structure of the fluid flow. i have
modeled the occurrence of a vortex as a result of collision among fluid jets
under certain conditions. chaotic occurrence of such vortices further
randomizes the velocity field. these together ultimately lead to turbulence. i
have also shown an application of vortex formation in a dynamic fluid in
atmospheric science., where it has been shown how an initial dusturbing
cyclonic vortex is created by collision between two linear wind jets under
certain conditions, which under favorable conditions, may mature into a severe
tropical storm. then a three dimensional mathematical modeling of the vortex
(assuming that it is going to become a matured storm) has been proposed with
computer simulations. this helps us to understand the mystery of origin of
cyclonic and anticyclonic vortices in atmosphere and some of their observed
asymmetries.

"a 3-fluid hydrodynamic model is introduced for simulating heavy-ion
collisions at incident energies between few and about 200 agev. in addition to
the two baryon-rich fluids of 2-fluid models, the new model incorporates a
third, baryon-free (i.e. with zero net baryonic charge) fluid which is created
in the mid-rapidity region. its evolution is delayed due to a formation time
$\tau$, during which the baryon-free fluid neither thermalizes nor interacts
with the baryon-rich fluids. after formation it thermalizes and starts to
interact with the baryon-rich fluids. it is found that for $\tau$=0 the
interaction strongly affects the baryon-free fluid. however, at reasonable
finite formation time, $\tau$=1 fm/c, the effect of this interaction turns out
to be substantially reduced although still noticeable. baryonic observables are
only slightly affected by the interaction with the baryon-free fluid.

"the linearized navier-stokes equations for a system of superposed immiscible
compressible ideal fluids are analyzed. the results of the analysis reconcile
the stabilizing and destabilizing effects of compressibility reported in the
literature. it is shown that the growth rate $n$ obtained for an inviscid,
compressible flow in an infinite domain is bounded by the growth rates obtained
for the corresponding incompressible flows with uniform and exponentially
varying density. as the equilibrium pressure at the interface $p_\infty$
increases (less compressible flow), $n$ increases towards the uniform density
result, while as the ratio of specific heats $\gamma$ increases (less
compressible fluid), $n$ decreases towards the exponentially varying density
incompressible flow result. this remains valid in the presence of surface
tension or for viscous fluids and the validity of the results is also discussed
for finite size domains. the critical wavenumber imposed by the presence of
surface tension is unaffected by compressibility. however, the results show
that the surface tension modifies the sensitivity of the growth rate to a
differential change in $\gamma$ for the lower and upper fluids. for the viscous
case, the linearized equations are solved numerically for different values of
$p_\infty$ and $\gamma$. it is found that the largest differences compared with
the incompressible cases are obtained at small atwood numbers. the most
unstable mode for the compressible case is also bounded by the most unstable
modes corresponding to the two limiting incompressible cases.

"the cellular potts model (cpm) is a robust, cell-level methodology for
simulation of biological tissues and morphogenesis. both tissue physiology and
morphogenesis depend on diffusion of chemical morphogens in the extra-cellular
fluid or matrix (ecm). standard diffusion solvers applied to the cellular potts
model use finite difference methods on the underlying cpm lattice. however,
these methods produce a diffusing field tied to the underlying lattice, which
is inaccurate in many biological situations in which cell or ecm movement
causes advection rapid compared to diffusion. finite difference schemes suffer
numerical instabilities solving the resulting advection-diffusion equations. to
circumvent these problems we simulate advection-diffusion within the framework
of the cpm using off-lattice finite-difference methods. we define a set of
generalized fluid particles which detach advection and diffusion from the
lattice. diffusion occurs between neighboring fluid particles by local
averaging rules which approximate the laplacian. directed spin flips in the cpm
handle the advective movement of the fluid particles. a constraint on relative
velocities in the fluid explicitly accounts for fluid viscosity. we use the cpm
to solve various diffusion examples including multiple instantaneous sources,
continuous sources, moving sources and different boundary geometries and
conditions to validate our approximation against analytical and established
numerical solutions. we also verify the cpm results for poiseuille flow and
taylor-aris dispersion.

"granular fluids consist of collections of activated mesoscopic or macroscopic
particles (e.g., powders or grains) whose flows often appear similar to those
of normal fluids. to explore the qualitative and quantitative description of
these flows an idealized model for such fluids, a system of smooth inelastic
hard spheres, is considered. the single feature distinguishing granular and
normal fluids being explored in this way is the inelasticity of collisions. the
dominant differences observed in real granular fluids are indeed captured by
this feature. following a brief introductory description of real granular
fluids and motivation for the idealized model, the elements of nonequilibrium
statistical mechanics are recalled (observables, states, and their dynamics).
peculiarities of the hard sphere interactions are developed in detail. the
exact microscopic balance equations for the number, energy, and momentum
densities are derived and their averages described as the origin for a possible
macroscopic continuum mechanics description. this formally exact analysis leads
to closed, macroscopic hydrodynamic equations through the notion of a ""normal""
state. this concept is introduced and the navier-stokes constitutive equations
are derived, with associated green-kubo expressions for the transport
coefficients. a parallel description of granular gases is described in the
context of kinetic theory, and the boltzmann limit is identified critically.

"the spacetimes for vaidya's radiating stellar exterior and kinnersley's
photon rocket in a cosmological background are obtained by performing the same
conformal transformation as is used to obtain the robertson-walker metric from
minkowski spacetime. in the case of the cosmological radiating stellar
exterior, a two-fluid solution is found that obeys all of the energy conditions
and consists of a null fluid and a perfect fluid that asymptotically falls off
to the standard cosmological values for pressure and density at infinite
radius. for the cosmological photon rocket, the massless case is first
interpreted to obtain a solution for an accelerating cosmological reference
frame, and then the general case is interpreted: in both cases, a two-fluid
solution is found that consists of a null fluid and an imperfect fluid that
possesses heat conduction and anisotropic stress. the imperfect fluid appears
to contain an inhomogeneous dark energy component that acts to accelerate the
matter through space via a pressure gradient, but this component has negative
energy density on the trailing side of the rocket, meaning only the leading
side of the rocket is guaranteed to satisfy the weak and dominant energy
conditions. unlike spacetimes that have rotation but no acceleration, the
cosmological photon rocket can serve as an example of a spacetime that
contradicts mach's notion of acceleration, since an observer would see
empirical evidence of acceleration even though the matter does not accelerate

"we analyse the influence of pre-stress on the propagation of interfacial
waves along the boundary of an incompressible hyperelastic half-space that is
in contact with a viscous fluid extending to infinity in the adjoining
half-space. one aim is to derive rigorously the incremental boundary conditions
at the interface; this derivation is delicate because of the interplay between
the lagrangian and the eulerian descriptions but is crucial for numerous
problems concerned with the interaction between a compliant wall and a viscous
fluid. a second aim of this work is to model the ultrasonic waves used in the
assessment of aortic aneurysms, and here we find that for this purpose the
half-space idealization is justified at high frequencies. a third goal is to
shed some light on the stability behaviour in compression of the solid
half-space, as compared with the situation in the absence of fluid; we find
that the usual technique of seeking standing waves solutions is not appropriate
when the half-space is in contact with a fluid; in fact, a correct analysis
reveals that the presence of a viscous fluid makes a compressed neo-hookean
half-space slightly more stable. for a wave travelling in a direction of
principal strain, we obtain results for the case of a general (incompressible
isotropic) strain-energy function. for a wave travelling parallel to the
interface and in an arbitrary direction in a plane of principal strain, we

"background : the carnivorous plants of the genus nepenthes, widely
distributed in the asian tropics, rely mostly on nutrients derived from
arthropods trapped in their pitcher-shaped leaves and digested by their
enzymatic fluid. the genus exhibits a great diversity of prey and pitcher forms
and its mechanism of trapping has long intrigued scientists. the slippery inner
surfaces of the pitchers, which can be waxy or highly wettable, have so far
been considered as the key trapping devices. however, the occurrence of species
lacking such epidermal specializations but still effective at trapping insects
suggests the possible implication of other mechanisms. methodology/principal
findings : using a combination of insect bioassays, high-speed video and
rheological measurements, we show that the digestive fluid of nepenthes
rafflesiana is highly viscoelastic and that this physical property is crucial
for the retention of insects in its traps. trapping efficiency is shown to
remain strong even when the fluid is highly diluted by water, as long as the
elastic relaxation time of the fluid is higher than the typical time scale of
insect movements. conclusions/significance : this finding challenges the common
classification of nepenthes pitchers as simple passive traps and is of great
adaptive significance for these tropical plants, which are often submitted to
high rainfalls and variations in fluid concentration. the viscoelastic trap
constitutes a cryptic but potentially widespread adaptation of nepenthes
species and could be a homologous trait shared through common ancestry with the
sundew (drosera) flypaper plants. such large production of a highly
viscoelastic biopolymer fluid in permanent pools is nevertheless unique in the
plant kingdom and suggests novel applications for pest control.

"a wave equation, that governs finite amplitude acoustic disturbances in a
thermoviscous newtonian fluid, and includes nonlinear terms up to second order,
is proposed. in contrast to the model known as the kuznetsov equation, the
proposed nonlinear wave equation preserves the hamiltonian structure of the
fundamental fluid dynamical equations in the non-dissipative limit. an exact
traveling front solution is obtained from a generalized traveling wave
assumption. this solution is, in an overall sense, equivalent to the taylor
shock solution of the burgers equation. however, in contrast to the burgers
equation, the model equation considered here is capable to describe waves
propagating in opposite directions. owing to the hamiltonian structure of the
proposed model equation, the front solution is in agreement with the classical
rankine-hugoniot relations. the exact front solution propagates at supersonic
speed with respect to the fluid ahead of it, and subsonic speed with respect to
the fluid behind it, similarly to the fluid dynamical shock. linear stability
analysis reveals that the front is stable when the acoustic pressure belongs to
a critical interval, and is otherwise unstable. these results are verified

orindary-fluid stars. however, the oscillation frequency of the $f_{\rm

a homogenous two-fluid stellar model in newtonian gravity. next the coupling
effect between the two fluids is studied via a parameterized model of
entrainment. we find that the coupling in general breaks the universal behavior
seen in the case of decoupled fluids. based on a relativistic variational

asymmetric, non-reciprocating motion is generated by tuning an external
magnetic field. to obtain the magnetic field and associated magnetization local
to the cilia we solve the maxwell equations, from which the magnetic torques
can be deduced. to obtain the ciliary motion we solve the dynamic equations of
motion which are then fully coupled to the fluid dynamic equations that
describe fluid flow around the cilia. by doing so we show that by properly
tuning the applied magnetic field, asymmetric ciliary motion can be generated
that is able to propel fluid in a microchannel. the results are presented in
terms of three dimensionless parameters that fully delineate the asymmetry and

"a flexible sheet in uniform parallel flow is studied in order to quantify its
fluid dynamic drag and fluid-elastic stability characteristics. an experimental
campaign is undertaken that involves a cantilevered sheet in air flow
characterised by reynolds numbers of order r=10^4-10^6. the properties of the
sheet include: constant mass per unit area; small but finite flexural rigidity;
varying aspect ratios from within the range 0.43<l/l<1, where l and l denote
the length and width respectively; and tension applied at the trailing edge.
the unique aspect of the present work is an investigation into the influence of
in-plane tension on both the fluid drag and fluid-elastic stability of the
sheet. in the absence of tension, the configuration resembles a flag and the
drag coefficient is observed to decrease with increasing aspect ratio and
reynolds number. in the presence of tension, the fluid drag is significantly
reduced in the region below the critical flow velocity at which convected wave
instabilities appear. this critical flow velocity can be increased through the
moderate application of in-plane tension. under lateral tension, the drag of
the sheet is given to good approximation by the turbulent boundary layer drag
law for a flat plate. once stability is lost, however, the drag coefficient
increases rapidly with reynolds number due to convected waves travelling over
the sheet's surface.

their study difficult or impossible. a novel technique to measure the dynamical

shape and topological changes (e.g. fusion, fission) of fluid membrane systems.
fluidity is key to the versatility and constant reorganization of lipid

from the friction of the lipid molecules as they rearrange to accommodate shape
changes, in the dynamics of morphological changes of fluid vesicles. in
particular, we analyze the competition between the membrane viscosity and the

mechanism. we consider the relaxation dynamics of fluid vesicles put in an
out-of-equilibrium state, but conclusions can be drawn regarding the kinetics
or power consumption in regulated shape changes in the cell. on the basis of
numerical calculations, we find that the dynamics arising from the membrane
viscosity are qualitatively different from the dynamics arising from the bulk
viscosity. when these two dissipation mechanisms are put in competition, we
find that for small vesicles the membrane dissipation dominates, with a
relaxation time that scales as the size of the vesicle to the power 2. for
large vesicles, the bulk dissipation dominates, and the exponent in the

prescribing forms for the specific helmholtz potential and the rate of
dissipation, we derive the relations for the partial stress in the solid, the
partial stress in the fluid, the interaction force between the solid and the
fluid, and the evolution equation of the natural configuration of the solid. we
also use the assumption that the volume of the mixture is equal to the sum of
the volumes of the two constituents in their natural state as a constraint.

non-zero longitudinal displacement. arterial walls are modeled by a {linearly
viscoelastic, cylindrical koiter shell model capturing both radial and
longitudinal displacement}. fluid flow is modeled by the navier-stokes
equations for an incompressible, viscous fluid. the two are fully coupled via
kinematic and dynamic coupling conditions. our numerical scheme is based on a
new modified lie operator splitting that decouples the fluid and structure
sub-problems in a way that leads to a loosely coupled scheme which is
{unconditionally} stable. this was achieved by a clever use of the kinematic
coupling condition at the fluid and structure sub-problems, leading to an
implicit coupling between the fluid and structure velocities. the proposed
scheme is a modification of the recently introduced ""kinematically coupled
scheme"" for which the newly proposed modified lie splitting significantly
increases the accuracy. the performance and accuracy of the scheme were studied
on a couple of instructive examples including a comparison with a monolithic
scheme. it was shown that the accuracy of our scheme was comparable to that of
the monolithic scheme, while our scheme retains all the main advantages of
partitioned schemes, such as modularity, simple implementation, and low
computational costs.

"when submillimetric particles are confined in a fluid such that a compact
cluster of particles lie above the clear fluid, particles will detach from the
lower boundary of the cluster and form an unstable separation front giving rise
to growing fingers of falling particles. we study this problem using both
experiments and hybrid granular/fluid mechanics models. in the case of
particles from 50 to 500 microns in diameter falling in air, we study the
horizontal density fluctuations at early times: the amplitude of the density
difference between two points at a certain horizontal distance grows as a power
law of time. this happens up to a saturation corresponding to a power law of
the distance. the way in which the correlation length builds up to this
saturation also follows a power law of time. we show that these decompaction
fronts in sedimentation problems follow a family-vicsek scaling, characterize
the dynamic and hurst exponent of the lateral density fluctuations,
respectively z \sim 1 and \zeta \sim 0.75, and show how the prefactors depend
on the grain diameter. we also show from similar simulations with a more
viscous and incompressible fluid, that this feature is independent of the fluid
compressibility or viscosity, ranging from air to water/glycerol mixtures.

"self-sustained oscillations resulting from fluid-solid instabilities, such as
the flutter of a flexible flag in axial flow, can be used to harvest energy if
one is able to convert the solid energy into electricity. here, this is
achieved using piezoelectric patches attached to the surface of the flag that
convert the solid deformation into an electric current powering purely
resistive output circuits. nonlinear numerical simulations in the slender-body
limit, based on an explicit description of the coupling between the fluid-solid
and electric systems, are used to determine the harvesting efficiency of the
system, namely the fraction of the flow kinetic energy flux effectively used to
power the output circuit, and its evolution with the system's parameters. the
role of the tuning between the characteristic frequencies of the fluid-solid
and electric systems is emphasized, as well as the critical impact of the
piezoelectric coupling intensity. high fluid loading, classically associated
with destabilization by damping, leads to greater energy harvesting, but with a
weaker robustness to flow velocity fluctuations due to the sensitivity of the
flapping mode selection. this suggests that a control of this mode selection by
a careful design of the output circuit could provide some opportunities of
improvement for the efficiency and robustness of the energy harvesting process.

"we use numerical simulations to address locomotion at zero reynolds number in
viscoelastic (giesekus) fluids. the swimmers are assumed to be spherical, to
self-propel using tangential surface deformation, and the computations are
implemented using a finite element method. the emphasis of the study is on the
change of the swimming kinematics, energetics, and flow disturbance from
newtonian to viscoelastic, and on the distinction between pusher and puller
swimmers. in all cases, the viscoelastic swimming speed is below the newtonian
one, with a minimum obtained for intermediate values of the weissenberg number,
$we$. an analysis of the flow field places the origin of this swimming
degradation in non-newtonian elongational stresses. the power required for
swimming is also systematically below the newtonian power, and always a
decreasing function of $we$. a detail energetic balance of the swimming problem
points at the polymeric part of the stress as the primary $we$-decreasing
energetic contribution, while the contributions of the work done by the swimmer
from the solvent remain essentially $we$-independent. in addition, we observe
negative values of the polymeric power density in some flow regions, indicating
positive elastic work by the polymers on the fluid. the hydrodynamic
efficiency, defined as the ratio of the useful to total rate of work, is always
above the newtonian case, with a maximum relative value obtained at
intermediate weissenberg numbers. finally, the presence of polymeric stresses
leads to an increase of the rate of decay of the flow velocity in the fluid,
and a decrease of the magnitude of the stresslet governing the magnitude of the
effective bulk stress in the fluid.

"we develop an inertial coupling method for modeling the dynamics of
point-like 'blob' particles immersed in an incompressible fluid, generalizing
previous work for compressible fluids. the coupling consistently includes
excess (positive or negative) inertia of the particles relative to the
displaced fluid, and accounts for thermal fluctuations in the fluid momentum
equation. the coupling between the fluid and the blob is based on a no-slip
constraint equating the particle velocity with the local average of the fluid
velocity, and conserves momentum and energy. we demonstrate that the
formulation obeys a fluctuation-dissipation balance, owing to the
non-dissipative nature of the no-slip coupling. we develop a spatio-temporal
discretization that preserves, as best as possible, these properties of the
continuum formulation. in the spatial discretization, the local averaging and
spreading operations are accomplished using compact kernels commonly used in
immersed boundary methods. we find that the special properties of these kernels
make the discrete blob a particle with surprisingly physically-consistent
volume, mass, and hydrodynamic properties. we develop a second-order
semi-implicit temporal integrator that maintains discrete
fluctuation-dissipation balance, and is not limited in stability by viscosity.
furthermore, the temporal scheme requires only constant-coefficient poisson and
helmholtz linear solvers, enabling a very efficient and simple fft-based
implementation on gpus. we numerically investigate the performance of the
method on several standard test problems...

"in this work we consider how surface-adherent bacterial biofilm communities
respond in flowing systems. we simulate the fluid-structure interaction and
separation process using the immersed boundary method. in these simulations we
model and simulate different density and viscosity values of the biofilm than
that of the surrounding fluid. the simulation also includes breakable springs
connecting the bacteria in the biofilm. this allows the inclusion of erosion
and detachment into the simulation. we use the incompressible navier-stokes
(n-s) equations to describe the motion of the flowing fluid. we discretize the
fluid equations using finite differences and use a geometric multigrid method
to solve the resulting equations at each time step. the use of multigrid is
necessary because of the dramatically different densities and viscosities
between the biofilm and the surrounding fluid. we investigate and simulate the
model in both two and three dimensions.
  our method differs from previous attempts of using ibm for modeling
biofilm/flow interactions in the following ways: the density and viscosity of
the biofilm can differ from the surrounding fluid, and the lagrangian node
locations correspond to experimentally measured bacterial cell locations from
3d images taken of staphylococcus epidermidis in a biofilm.

"amplification of deterministic disturbances in inertialess shear-driven
channel flows of viscoelastic fluids is examined by analyzing the frequency
responses from spatio-temporal body forces to the velocity and polymer stress
fluctuations. in strongly elastic flows, we show that disturbances with large
streamwise length scales may be significantly amplified even in the absence of
inertia. for fluctuations without streamwise variations, we derive explicit
analytical expressions for the dependence of the worst-case amplification (from
different forcing to different velocity and polymer stress components) on the
weissenberg number ($we$), the maximum extensibility of the polymer chains
($l$), the viscosity ratio, and the spanwise wavenumber. for the oldroyd-b
model, the amplification of the most energetic components of velocity and
polymer stress fields scales as $we^2$ and $we^4$. on the other hand, finite
extensibility of polymer molecules limits the largest achievable amplification
even in flows with infinitely large weissenberg numbers: in the presence of
wall-normal and spanwise forces the amplification of the streamwise velocity
and polymer stress fluctuations is bounded by quadratic and quartic functions
of $l$. this high amplification signals low robustness to modeling
imperfections of inertialess channel flows of viscoelastic fluids. the
underlying physical mechanism involves interactions of polymer stress
fluctuations with a base shear, and it represents a close analog of the lift-up
mechanism that initiates a bypass transition in inertial flows of newtonian
fluids.

"in this paper a stationary action principle is proven to hold for capillary
fluids, i.e. fluids for which the deformation energy has the form suggested,
starting from molecular arguments, for instance by cahn and hilliard. remark
that these fluids are sometimes also called korteweg-de vries or cahn-allen. in
general continua whose deformation energy depend on the second gradient of
placement are called second gradient (or piola-toupin or mindlin or
green-rivlin or germain or second gradient) continua. in the present paper, a
material description for second gradient continua is formulated. a lagrangian
action is introduced in both material and spatial description and the
corresponding euler-lagrange bulk and boundary conditions are found. these
conditions are formulated in terms of an objective deformation energy volume
density in two cases: when this energy is assumed to depend on either c and
grad c or on c^-1 and grad c^-1 ; where c is the cauchy-green deformation
tensor. when particularized to energies which characterize fluid materials, the
capillary fluid evolution conditions (see e.g. casal or seppecher for an
alternative deduction based on thermodynamic arguments) are recovered. a
version of bernoulli law valid for capillary fluids is found and, in the
appendix b, useful kinematic formulas for the present variational formulation
are proposed. historical comments about gabrio piola's contribution to

"we present a generalization of the inertial coupling (ic) [usabiaga et al. j.
comp. phys. 2013] which permits the resolution of radiation forces on small
particles with arbitrary acoustic contrast factor. the ic method is based on a
eulerian-lagrangian approach: particles move in continuum space while the fluid
equations are solved in a regular mesh (here we use the finite volume method).
thermal fluctuations in the fluid stress, important below the micron scale, are
also taken into account following the landau-lifshitz fluid description. each
particle is described by a minimal cost resolution which consists on a single
small kernel (bell-shaped function) concomitant to the particle. the main role
of the particle kernel is to interpolate fluid properties and spread particle
forces. here, we extend the kernel functionality to allow for an arbitrary
particle compressibility. the particle-fluid force is obtained from an imposed
no-slip constraint which enforces similar particle and kernel fluid velocities.
this coupling is instantaneous and permits to capture the fast, non-linear
effects underlying the radiation forces on particles. acoustic forces arise
either because an excess in particle compressibility (monopolar term) or in
mass (dipolar contribution) over the fluid values. comparison with theoretical
expressions show that the present generalization of the ic method correctly
reproduces both contributions. due to its low computational cost, the present
method allows for simulations with many particles using a standard graphical
processor unit (gpu).

"in this paper we discuss conservation laws in ideal magnetohydrodynamics
(mhd) and gas dynamics associated with advected invariants. the invariants in
some cases, can be related to fluid relabelling symmetries associated with the
lagrangian map. there are different classes of invariants that are advected or
lie dragged with the flow. simple examples are the advection of the entropy s
(a 0-form), and the conservation of magnetic flux (an invariant 2-form advected
with the flow). the magnetic flux conservation law is equivalent to faraday's
equation. we discuss the gauge condition required for the magnetic helicity to
be advected with the flow. the conditions for the cross helicity to be an
invariant are discussed. we discuss the different variants of helicity in fluid
dynamics and in mhd, including: fluid helicity, cross helicity and magnetic
helicity. the fluid helicity conservation law and the cross helcity
conservation law in mhd are derived for the case of a barotropic gas. if the
magnetic field lies in the constant entropy surface, then the gas pressure can
depend on both the entropy and the density. in these cases the conservation
laws are local conservation laws. we obtain nonlocal conservation laws for
fluid helicity and cross helicity for non-barotropic fluids using the clebsch
variable formulation of gas dynamics and mhd. ertel's theorem and potential

"a residual-based lubrication method is used in this paper to find the flow

fluid models: ellis and herschel-bulkley. the method was validated by
convergence behavior sensibility tests, convergence to analytical solutions for
the straight tubes as special cases for the converging-diverging tubes,
convergence to analytical solutions found earlier for the flow in
converging-diverging tubes of newtonian fluids as special cases for
non-newtonian, and convergence to analytical solutions found earlier for the

was also conducted on a sample of diverging-converging geometries. the method
can in principle be extended to the flow of viscoelastic and
thixotropic/rheopectic fluid categories. the method can also be extended to
geometries varying in size and shape in the flow direction, other than the
perfect cylindrically-symmetric converging-diverging ones, as long as
characteristic flow relations correlating the flow rate to the pressure drop on
the discretized elements of the lubrication approximation can be found. these

"the phenomenon of electrowetting, i.e., the dependence of the macroscopic
contact angle of a fluid on the electrostatic potential of the substrate, is
analyzed in terms of the density functional theory of wetting. it is shown that
electrowetting is not an electrocapillarity effect, i.e., it cannot be
consistently understood in terms of the variation of the substrate-fluid
interfacial tension with the electrostatic substrate potential, but it is
related to the depth of the effective interface potential. the key feature,
which has been overlooked so far and which occurs naturally in the density
functional approach is the structural change of a fluid if it is brought into
contact with another fluid. these structural changes occur in the present
context as the formation of finite films of one fluid phase in between the
substrate and the bulk of the other fluid phase. the non-vanishing donnan
potentials (galvani potential differences) across such film-bulk fluid
interfaces, which generically occur due to an unequal partitioning of ions as a
result of differences of solubility contrasts, lead to correction terms in the
electrowetting equation, which become relevant for sufficiently small substrate
potentials. whereas the present density functional approach confirms the
commonly used electrocapillarity-based electrowetting equation as a good
approximation for the cases of metallic electrodes or electrodes coated with a
hydrophobic dielectric in contact with an electrolyte solution and an ion-free
oil, a significantly reduced tendency for electrowetting is predicted for
electrodes coated with a dielectric which is hydrophilic or which is in contact

"we perform one of the first studies into the nonlinear evolution of tidally
excited inertial waves in a uniformly rotating fluid body, exploring a
simplified model of the fluid envelope of a planet (or the convective envelope
of a solar-type star) subject to the gravitational tidal perturbations of an
orbiting companion. our model contains a perfectly rigid spherical core, which
is surrounded by an envelope of incompressible uniform density fluid. the
corresponding linear problem was studied in previous papers which this work
extends into the nonlinear regime, at moderate ekman numbers (the ratio of
viscous to coriolis accelerations). by performing high-resolution numerical
simulations, using a combination of pseudo-spectral and spectral element
methods, we investigate the effects of nonlinearities, which lead to
time-dependence of the flow and the corresponding dissipation rate. angular
momentum is deposited non-uniformly, leading to the generation of significant
differential rotation in the initially uniformly rotating fluid, i.e. the body
does not evolve towards synchronism as a simple solid body rotator. this
differential rotation modifies the properties of tidally excited inertial
waves, changes the dissipative properties of the flow, and eventually becomes
unstable to a secondary shear instability provided that the ekman number is
sufficiently small. our main result is that the inclusion of nonlinearities
eventually modifies the flow and the resulting dissipation from what linear
calculations would predict, which has important implications for tidal
dissipation in fluid bodies. we finally discuss some limitations of our
simplified model, and propose avenues for future research to better understand
the tidal evolution of rotating planets and stars.

known to be susceptible to the formation of shear bands and other localized

that the nonlinearities present in this wlm solution break time-reversal

motion towards the bead-end of the particle at low de, net motion towards the

high de. at low de, where the particle time-scale is longer then the fluid
relaxation time, we believe that propulsion is caused by an imbalance in the
fluid first normal stress differences between the two ends of the particle

"the point vortex system is usually considered as an idealized model where the
vorticity of an ideal incompressible two-dimensional fluid is concentrated in a
finite number of moving points. in the case of a single vortex in an otherwise
irrotational ideal fluid occupying a bounded and simply-connected
two-dimensional domain the motion is given by the so-called kirchhoff-routh
velocity which depends only on the domain. the main result of this paper
establishes that this dynamics can also be obtained as the limit of the motion
of a rigid body immersed in such a fluid when the body shrinks to a massless
point particle with fixed circulation. the rigid body is assumed to be only
accelerated by the force exerted by the fluid pressure on its boundary, the
fluid velocity and pressure being given by the incompressible euler equations,
with zero vorticity. the circulation of the fluid velocity around the particle
is conserved as time proceeds according to kelvin's theorem and gives the
strength of the limit point vortex. we also prove that in the different regime
where the body shrinks with a fixed mass the limit dynamics is governed by a

"direct numerical simulation of the gravity-induced settling of finite-size
particles in triply-periodic domains has been performed under dilute
conditions. for a single solid-to-fluid density ratio of 1.5 we have considered
two values of the galileo number corresponding to steady vertical motion
(ga=121) and to steady oblique motion (ga=178) in the case of one isolated
sphere. for the multi-particle system we observe strong particle clustering
only in the latter case. the geometry and time scales related to clustering are
determined from voronoi tesselation and particle-conditioned averaging. as a
consequence of clustering, the average particle settling velocity is increased
by 12% as compared to the value of an isolated sphere; such a collective effect
is not observed in the non-clustering case. by defining a local (instantaneous)
fluid velocity average in the vicinity of the finite-size particles it is shown
that the observed enhancement of the settling velocity is due to the fact that
the downward fluid motion (with respect to the global average) which is induced
in the cluster regions is preferentially sampled by the particles. it is
further observed that the variance of the particle velocity is strongly
enhanced in the clustering case. with the aid of a decomposition of the
particle velocity it is shown that this increase is due to enhanced fluid
velocity fluctuations (due to clustering) in the vicinity of the particles.
finally, we discuss a possible explanation for the observation of a critical

"flagellated bacteria exploiting helical propulsion are known to swim along
circular trajectories near surfaces. fluid dynamics predicts this circular
motion to be clockwise (cw) above a rigid surface (when viewed from inside the
fluid) and counter-clockwise (ccw) below a free surface. recent experimental
investigations showed that complex physicochemical processes at the nearby
surface could lead to a change in the direction of rotation, both at solid
surfaces absorbing slip-inducing polymers and interfaces covered with
surfactants. motivated by these results, we use a far-field hydrodynamic model
to predict the kinematics of swimming near three types of interfaces: clean
fluid-fluid interface, slipping rigid wall, and a fluid interface covered by
incompressible surfactants. representing the helical swimmer by a superposition
of hydrodynamic singularities, we first show that in all cases the surfaces
reorient the swimmer parallel to the surface and attract it, both of which are
a consequence of the stokes dipole component of the swimmer flow field. we then
show that circular motion is induced by a higher-order singularity, namely a
rotlet dipole, and that its rotation direction (cw vs. ccw) is strongly
affected by the boundary conditions at the interface and the bacteria shape.
our results suggest thus that the hydrodynamics of complex interfaces provide a

"we continue our investigation to the use of the variational method to derive
flow relations for generalized newtonian fluids in confined geometries. while
in the previous investigations we used the straight circular tube geometry with
eight fluid rheological models to demonstrate and establish the variational
method, the focus here is on the plane long thin slit geometry using those
eight rheological models, namely: newtonian, power law, ree-eyring, carreau,
cross, casson, bingham and herschel-bulkley. we demonstrate how the variational
principle based on minimizing the total stress in the flow conduit can be used
to derive analytical expressions, which are previously derived by other
methods, or used in conjunction with numerical procedures to obtain numerical
solutions which are virtually identical to the solutions obtained previously
from well established methods of fluid dynamics. in this regard, we use the
method of weissenberg-rabinowitsch-mooney-schofield (wrms), with our adaptation
from the circular pipe geometry to the long thin slit geometry, to derive
analytical formulae for the eight types of fluid where these derived formulae
are used for comparison and validation of the variational formulae and
numerical solutions. although some examples may be of little value, the
optimization principle which the variational method is based upon has a
significant theoretical value as it reveals the tendency of the flow system to
assume a configuration that minimizes the total stress. our proposal also
offers a new methodology to tackle common problems in fluid dynamics and

so-called lomen hypothesis which assumes the vorticity is null in the moving
frame. we establish in this contribution that this hypothesis is valid only for
uniform rotational motions. we give a more general formulation of this coupling
problem, with a compact formulation. we consider the mechanical modeling of a
rigid body with a motion of small amplitude, containing an incompressible fluid
in the linearized regime. we first establish that the fluid motion remains
irrotational in a galilean referential if it is true at the initial time. when
continuity of normal velocity and pressure are prescribed on the free surface,
we establish that the global coupled problem conserves an energy functional
composed by three terms. we introduce the stokes - zhukovsky vector fields,
solving neumann problems for the laplace operator in the fluid in order to
represent the rotational rigid motion with irrotational vector fields. then we
have a good framework to consider the coupled problem between the fluid and the
rigid motion. the coupling between the free surface and the ad hoc component of
the velocity potential introduces a ""neumann to dirichlet"" operator that allows
to write the coupled system in a very compact form. the final expression of a

"it is known that the dynamics of dissipative fluids in eulerian variables can
be derived from an algebra of leibniz brackets of observables, the metriplectic
algebra, that extends the poisson algebra of the zero viscosity limit via a
symmetric, semidefinite component. this metric bracket generates dissipative
forces.
  the metriplectic algebra includes the conserved total hamiltonian $h$,
generating the non-dissipative part of dynamics, and the entropy $s$ of those
microscopic degrees of freedom draining energy irreversibly, that generates
dissipation. this $s$ is a casimir of the poisson algebra to which the
metriplectic algebra reduces in the frictionless limit.
  in the present paper, the metriplectic framework for viscous fluids is
re-written in the lagrangian formulation, where the system is described through
material variables: this is a way to describe the continuum much closer to the
discrete system dynamics than the eulerian fields. accordingly, the full
metriplectic algebra is constructed in material variables, and this will render
it possible to apply it in all those cases in which the lagrangian formulation
is preferred.
  the role of the entropy $s$ of a metriplectic system is as paramount as that
of the hamiltonian $h$, but this fact may be underestimated in the eulerian
formulation because $s$ is not the only casimir of the symplectic non-canonical
part of the algebra. instead, when the dynamics of the non-ideal fluid is
written through the parcel variables of the lagrangian formulation, the fact
that entropy is symplectically invariant appears to be more clearly related to
its dependence on the microscopic degrees of freedom of the fluid, that do not
participate at all to the symplectic canonical part of the algebra (which,
indeed, involves and evolves only the macroscopic degrees of freedom of the
fluid parcel).

"granular fronts are a common yet unexplained phenomenon emerging during the
gravity driven free-surface flow of concentrated suspensions. they are usually
believed to be the result of fluid convection in combination with particle size
segregation. however, suspensions composed of uniformly sized particles also
develop a granular front. within a large rotating drum, a stationary
recirculating avalanche is generated. the flowing material is a mixture of a
visco-plastic fluid obtained from a kaolin-water dispersion, with spherical
ceramic particles denser than the fluid. the goal is to mimic the composition
of many common granular-fluid materials, like fresh concrete or debris flow. in
these materials, granular and fluid phases have the natural tendency to
segregate due to particle settling. however, through the shearing caused by the
rotation of the drum, a reorganization of the phases is induced, leading to the
formation of a granular front. by tuning the material properties and the drum
velocity, it is possible to control this phenomenon. the setting is reproduced
in a numerical environment, where the fluid is solved by a lattice-boltzmann
method, and the particles are explicitly represented using the discrete element
method. the simulations confirm the findings of the experiments, and provide
insight into the internal mechanisms. comparing the time-scale of particle
settling with the one of particle recirculation, a non-dimensional number is

0.5-1%, while the solid to fluid density ratio 1.02. the particle radius is
chosen to be approximately 6 komlogorov lengthscales. the results show that the
mean settling velocity is lower in an already turbulent flow than in a

fluid is about 12\% and 14\% for the two volume fractions investigated. the
probability density function of the particle velocity is almost gaussian in a

these tails are associated to the intermittent fast sedimentation of particle
pairs in drafting-kissing-tumbling motions. the particle lateral dispersion is
higher in a turbulent flow, whereas the vertical one is, surprisingly, of
comparable magnitude as a consequence of the highly intermittent behavior
observed in the quiescent fluid. using the concept of mean relative velocity we
estimate the mean drag coefficient from empirical formulas and show that non
stationary effects, related to vortex shedding, explain the increased reduction
in mean settling velocity in a turbulent environment.

"many small organisms self-propel in viscous fluids using travelling wave-like
deformation of their bodies or appendages. examples include small nematodes
moving through soil using whole-body undulations or spermatozoa swimming
through mucus using flagellar waves. when self-propulsion occurs in a
non-newtonian fluid, one fundamental question is whether locomotion will occur
faster or slower than in a newtonian environment. here we consider the general
problem of swimming using small-amplitude periodic waves in a viscoelastic
fluid described by the classical oldroyd-b constitutive relationship. using
taylor's swimming sheet model, we show that if all travelling waves move in the
same direction, the locomotion speed of the organism is systematically
decreased. however, if we allow waves to travel in two opposite directions, we
show that this can lead to enhancement of the swimming speed, which is
physically interpreted as due to asymmetric viscoelastic damping of waves with
different frequencies. a change of the swimming direction is also possible. by
analysing in detail the cases of swimming using two or three travelling waves,
we demonstrate that swimming can be enhanced in a viscoelastic fluid for all
deborah numbers below a critical value or, for three waves or more, only for a
finite, non-zero range of deborah numbers, in which case a finite amount of
elasticity in the fluid is required to increase the swimming speed.

"in biological transport mechanisms such as insect respiration and renal
filtration, fluid travels along a leaky channel allowing exchange with systems
exterior the the channel. the channels in these systems may undergo peristaltic
pumping which is thought to enhance the material exchange. to date, little
analytic work has been done to study the effect of pumping on material
extraction across the channel walls. in this paper, we examine a fluid
extraction model in which fluid flowing through a leaky channel is exchanged
with fluid in a reservoir. the channel walls are allowed to contract and expand
uniformly, simulating a pumping mechanism. in order to efficiently determine
solutions of the model, we derive a formal power series solution for the stokes
equations in a finite channel with uniformly contracting/expanding permeable
walls. this flow has been well studied in the case of weakly permeable channel
walls in which the normal velocity at the channel walls is proportional to the
wall velocity. in contrast we do not assume weakly driven flow, but flow driven
by hydrostatic pressure, and we use dacry's law to close our system for normal
wall velocity. we use our flow solution to examine flux across the
channel-reservoir barrier and demonstrate that pumping can either enhance or
impede fluid extraction across channel walls. we find that associated with each
set of physical flow and pumping parameters, there are optimal reservoir
conditions that maximizes the amount of material flowing from the channel into
the reservoir.

"fluid deformation and strain history are central to wide range of fluid
mechanical phenomena ranging from fluid mixing and particle transport to stress
development in complex fluids and the formation of lagrangian coherent
structures (lcss). to understand and model these processes it is necessary to
quantify lagrangian deformation in terms of eulerian flow properties, currently
an open problem. to elucidate this link we develop a protean (streamline)
coordinate transform for steady three-dimensional (3d) flows which renders both
the velocity gradient and deformation gradient upper triangular. this frame not
only simplifies computation of fluid deformation metrics such as finite-time
lyapunov exponents (ftles) and elucidates the deformation structure of the
flow, but moreover explicitly recovers kinematic and topological constraints
upon deformation such as those related to helicity density and the
poincar\'{e}-bendixson theorem. we apply this transform to several classes of
steady 3d flow, including helical and non-helical, compressible and
incompressible flows, and find random flows exhibit remarkably simple
(gaussian) deformation structure, and so are fully characterised in terms of a
small number of parameters. as such this technique provides the basis for the
development of stochastic models of fluid deformation in random flows which
adhere to the kinematic constraints inherent to various flow classes.

"we study by molecular dynamics simulations the thermodynamics of an anomalous
fluid confined in a slit pore with one wall structured and attractive and
another unstructured and repulsive. we find that the phase diagram of the
homogeneous part of the confined fluid is shifted to higher temperatures,
densities and pressures with respect to the bulk, but it can be rescaled on the
bulk case. we calculate a moderate increase of mobility of the homogeneous
confined fluid that we interpret as a consequence of the layering due to
confinement and the collective modes due to long-range correlations. we show
that, as in bulk, the confined fluid has structural, diffusion and density
anomalies, that order in the water-like hierarchy, and a liquid-liquid critical
point (llcp). the overall anomalous region moves to higher temperatures,
densities and pressure and the llcp displaces to higher temperature compared to
bulk. motivated by experiments, we calculate also the phase diagram not just
for the homogeneous part of the confined fluid but for the entire fluid in the
pore and show that it is shifted towards higher pressures but preserves the
thermodynamics, including the llcp. because our model has water-like
properties, we argue that in experiments with supercooled water confined in
slit pores with a width of > 3 nm if hydrophilic, and of > 1.5 nm if
hydrophobic, the existence of the llcp could be easier to test than in bulk,
where it is not directly accessible.

"we study the vapour-liquid phase behaviour of an ionic fluid confined in a
random porous matrix formed by uncharged hard sphere particles. the ionic fluid
is modelled as an equimolar binary mixture of oppositely charged equisized hard
spheres, the so-called restricted primitive model (rpm). considering the
matrix-fluid system as a partly-quenched model, we develop a theoretical
approach which combines the method of collective variables with the extension
of the scaled-particle theory (spt) for a hard-sphere fluid confined in a
disordered hard-sphere matrix. the approach allows us to formulate the
perturbation theory using the spt for the description of the thermodynamics of
the reference system. the phase diagrams of the rpm in matrices of different
porosities and for different size ratios of matrix and fluid particles are
calculated in the random-phase approximation and also when the effects of
higher-order correlations between ions are taken into account. both
approximations correctly reproduce the basic effects of porous media on the
vapour-liquid phase diagram, i.e., with a decrease of porosity the critical
point shifts toward lower fluid densities and lower temperatures and the
coexistence region is getting narrower. for the fixed matrix porosity, both the
critical temperature and the critical density increase with an increase of size
of matrix particles and tend to the critical values of the bulk rpm.

"considering the growing interest of the astrophysicist community in the study
of dissipative fluids with the aim of getting a more realistic description of
the universe, we present in this paper a physical analysis of the
energy-momentum tensor of a viscous fluid with heat flux. we introduce the
general form of this tensor and, using the approximation of small velocity
gradients, we relate the stresses of the fluid with the viscosity coefficients,
the shear tensor and the expansion factor. exploiting these relations, we can
write the stresses in terms of the extrinsic curvature of the normal surface to
the 4-velocity vector of the fluid, and we can also establish a connection
between the perfect fluid and the symmetries of the spacetime. on the other
hand, we calculate the energy conditions for a dissipative fluid through
contractions of the energy-momentum tensor with the 4-velocity vector of an
arbitrary observer. this method is interesting because it allows us to compute
the conditions in a reasonable easy way and without considering any
approximation or restriction on the energy-momentum tensor.

"the conservation of the enstrophy ($l^2$ norm of the vorticity $\omega$)
plays an essential role in the physics and mathematics of two-dimensional (2d)
euler fluids. generalizing to compressible ideal (inviscid and barotropic)
fluids, the generalized enstrophy $\int_{\sigma(t)} f(\omega/\rho)\rho\, d^2
x$, ($f$ an arbitrary smooth function, $\rho$ the density, and $\sigma(t)$ an
arbitrary 2d domain co-moving with the fluid) is a constant of motion, and
plays the same role. on the other hand, for the three-dimensional (3d) ideal
fluid, the helicity $\int_{m} {v}\cdot\omega\,d^3x$, ($v$ the flow velocity,
$\omega=\nabla\times v$, and ${m}$ the three-dimensional domain containing the
fluid) is conserved. evidently, the helicity degenerates in a 2d system, and
the (generalized) enstrophy emerges as a compensating constant. this transition
of the constants of motion is a reflection of an essential difference between
2d and 3d systems, because the conservation of the (generalized) enstrophy
imposes stronger constraints, than the helicity, on the flow. in this paper, we
make a deeper inquiry into the helicity-enstrophy interplay: the ideal fluid
mechanics is cast into a hamiltonian form in the phase space of clebsch
parameters, generalizing 2d to a wider category of epi-2d flows (2d embedded in
3d has zero helicity, while the converse is not true -- our epi-2d category
encompasses a wider class of zero-helicity flows); how helicity degenerates and
is substituted by a new constant is delineated; and how a further generalized
enstrophy is introduced as a constant of motion applying to epi-2d flow is
described.

"we investigate the dynamics of freely expanding liquid sheets prepared with
fluids with different rheological properties, (i) viscous fluids with a
zero-shear viscosity $\eta_0$ in the range $(1-1000) \, \mathrm{mpa.s}$ and
(ii) viscoelastic maxwell fluids whose elastic modulus, $g_0$, characteristic
relaxation time, $\tau$, and zero-shear viscosity, $\eta_0=g_0 \tau$, can be
tuned over several orders of magnitude. the sheets are produced by impacting a
drop of fluid on a small cylindrical solid target. for viscoelastic fluids, we
show that, when $\tau$ is shorter than the typical lifetime of the sheet ($\sim
10$ ms), the dynamics of the sheet is similar to that of newtonian viscous
liquids with equal zero-shear viscosity. in that case, for little viscous
samples ($\eta_0 <\sim 30$ mpa.s), the maximal expansion of the sheet,
$d_{\rm{max}}$, is independent of $\eta_0$, whereas for more viscous samples,
$d_{\rm{max}}$ decreases as $\eta_0$ increases. we provide a simple model to
account for the dependence of the maximal expansion of the sheet with the
viscosity that is based on an energy balance between inertia, surface tension
and viscous shear dissipation on the solid target, and which accounts well for
our experimental data. by contrast, when $\tau$ is longer than the typical
lifetime of the sheet, the behavior drastically differs. the sheet expansion is
strongly enhanced as compared to that of viscous samples with comparable
zero-shear viscosity, but is heterogeneous with the occurrence of cracks,
revealing the elastic nature of the viscoelastic fluid.

"in this paper, we study shearing spherically symmetric homogeneous density
fluids in comoving coordinates. it is found that the expansion of the
four-velocity of a perfect fluid is homogeneous, whereas its shear is generated
by an arbitrary function of time m(t), related to the mass function of the
distribution. this function is found to bear a functional relationship with
density. the field equations are reduced to two coupled first order ordinary
differential equations for the metric coefficients, g 11 and g 22. we have
explored a class of solutions assuming that m is a linear function of the
density. this class embodies, as a subcase, the complete class of shear-free
solutions. we have discussed the off quoted work of kustaanheimo (1947) and
have noted that it deals with shear-free fluids having anisotropic pressure. it
is shown that the anisotropy of the fluid is characterized by an arbitrary
function of time. we have discussed some issues of historical priorities and
credentials related to shear-free solutions. recent controversial claims by
mitra (2011, 2012) have also been addressed. we found that the singularity and
the shearing motion of the fluid are closely related. hence, there is a need
for fresh look to the solutions obtained earlier in comoving coordinates.

interaction (fsi) problems that allows for choosing fully implicit, single-step
and single-stage time integration schemes in the structure and fluid field
independently, and hence is tailored to the needs of the individual field. the
independent choice of time integration schemes is achieved by temporal
consistent interpolation of the interface traction. to reduce computational
costs, we introduce the possibility of field specific predictors in both

possible violations of the interface coupling conditions during the predictor

"we study the settling of finite-size rigid spheres in sustained homogeneous
isotropic turbulence (hit) by direct numerical simulations using an immersed
boundary method to account for the dispersed solid phase. we study semi-dilute
suspensions at different galileo numbers, ga. the galileo number is the ratio
between buoyancy and viscous forces, and is here varied via the solid-to-fluid
density ratio. the focus is on particles that are slightly heavier than the
fluid. we find that in hit, the mean settling speed is less than that in
quiescent fluid; in particular, it reduces by 6%-60% with respect to the
terminal velocity of an isolated sphere in quiescent fluid as the ratio between
the latter and the turbulent velocity fluctuations is decreased. analysing the
fluid-particle relative motion, we find that the mean settling speed is
progressively reduced while reducing the density ratio due to the increase of
the vertical drag induced by the particle cross-flow velocity. unsteady effects
contribute to the mean overall drag by about 6%-10%. the probability density
functions of particle velocities and accelerations reveal that these are
closely related to the features of the turbulent flow. the particle mean-square
displacement in the settling direction is found to be similar for all ga if
time is scaled by (2a)/u' (where 2a is the particle diameter and u' is the

"understanding the physics of phase-separation between solid and fluid phases
as a mixture mass moves down slope is a long-standing challenge. here, we
propose an extension of the two phase mass flow model (pudasaini, 2012) by
including a new mechanism, called separation-flux, that leads to strong
phase-separation in avalanche and debris flows while balancing the enhanced
solid flux with the reduced fluid flux. the separation flux mechanism is
capable of describing the dynamically evolving phase-separation and levee
formation in a multi-phase, geometrically three-dimensional debris flow. these
are often observed phenomena in natural debris flows and industrial processes
that involve the transportation of particulate solid-fluid mixture material.
the novel separation-flux model includes several dominant physical and
mechanical aspects such as pressure gradients, volume fractions of solid and
fluid phases and their gradients, shear-rates, flow depth, material friction,
viscosity, material densities, topographic constraints, grain size, etc. due to
the inherent separation mechanism, as the mass moves down slope, more and more
solid particles are transported to the front and the sides, resulting in
solid-rich and mechanically strong frontal surge head, and lateral levees
followed by a weaker tail largely consisting of viscous fluid. the primary
frontal solid-rich surge head followed by secondary fluid-rich surges is the
consequence of phase-separation. such typical and dominant phase-separation
phenomena are revealed for two-phase debris flow simulations. finally, changes
in flow composition, that are explicitly considered by the new modelling
approach, result in significant changes of impact pressure estimates. these are
highly important in hazard assessment and mitigation planning and highlight the
application potential of the new approach.

"the kinetic study of plasma sheaths is critical, among other things, to
understand the deposition of heat on walls, the effect of sputtering, and
contamination of the plasma with detrimental impurities. the plasma sheath also
provides a boundary condition and can often have a significant global impact on
the bulk plasma. in this paper, kinetic studies of classical sheaths are
performed with the continuum code, gkeyll, that directly solves the
vlasov-poisson/maxwell equations. the code uses a novel version of the
finite-element discontinuous galerkin (dg) scheme that conserves energy in the
continuous-time limit. the electrostatic field is computed using the poisson
equation. ionization and scattering collisions are included, however, surface
effects are neglected. the aim of this work is to introduce the
continuum-kinetic method and compare its results to those obtained from an
already established finite-volume multi-fluid model also implemented in gkeyll.
novel boundary conditions on the fluids allow the sheath to form without
specifying wall fluxes, so the fluids and fields adjust self-consistently at
the wall. the work presented here demonstrates that the kinetic and fluid
results are in agreement for the momentum flux, showing that in certain
regimes, a multi-fluid model can be a useful approximation for simulating the
plasma boundary. there are differences in the electrostatic potential between

"the extreme temperatures and energy densities generated by ultra-relativistic
collisions between heavy nuclei produce a state of matter with surprising fluid
properties. non-central collisions have angular momentum on the order of
1000$\hbar$, and the resulting fluid may have a strong vortical structure that
must be understood to properly describe the fluid. it is also of particular
interest because the restoration of fundamental symmetries of quantum
chromodynamics is expected to produce novel physical effects in the presence of
strong vorticity. however, no experimental indications of fluid vorticity in
heavy ion collisions have so far been found. here we present the first
measurement of an alignment between the angular momentum of a non-central
collision and the spin of emitted particles, revealing that the fluid produced
in heavy ion collisions is by far the most vortical system ever observed. we
find that $\lambda$ and $\overline{\lambda}$ hyperons show a positive
polarization of the order of a few percent, consistent with some hydrodynamic
predictions. a previous measurement that reported a null result at higher
collision energies is seen to be consistent with the trend of our new
observations, though with larger statistical uncertainties. these data provide
the first experimental access to the vortical structure of the ""perfect fluid""
created in a heavy ion collision. they should prove valuable in the development
of hydrodynamic models that quantitatively connect observations to the theory
of the strong force. our results extend the recent discovery of hydrodynamic

effect of the rheology of the shear-thinning liquid on two-phase flow
characteristics considering both gas/liquid and liquid/liquid systems.
concurrent and counter-current inclined systems are investigated, including the
mapping of multiple solution boundaries. aspects relevant to practical

model for this process of swimming under self-generated confinement. we solve
exactly for the flow and the locomotion speed of a spherical swimmer located in
a spherically symmetric system of two newtonian fluids whose boundary moves
with the swimmer. we also treat separately the special case of an immobile
outer fluid. in all cases, we characterise the flow fields, their spatial
decay, and the impact of both the viscosity ratio and the degree of confinement
on the locomotion speed of the model swimmer. the spatial decay of the flow
retains the same power-law decay as for locomotion in a single fluid but with a
decreased magnitude. independently of the assumption chosen to characterise the
impact of confinement on the actuation applied by the swimmer, its locomotion
speed always decreases with an increase in the degree of confinement. our
modelling results suggest that a low-viscosity region of at least six times the

"this paper is concerned with the partitioned iterative formulation to

monolithic elastic structural solver for constrained flexible multibody system
and the nonlinear iterative force correction scheme for coupling of the
turbulent fluid-flexible multibody system with nonmatching interface meshes.
while the fluid equations are discretized using a stabilized petrov-galerkin
formulation in space and the generalized-$\alpha$ updates in time, the
multibody system utilizes a discontinuous space-time galerkin finite element
method. we address two key challenges in the present formulation. firstly, the
coupling of the incompressible turbulent flow with a system of nonlinear
elastic bodies described in a co-rotated frame. secondly, the projection of the
tractions and displacements across the nonmatching 3d fluid surface elements
and the one-dimensional line elements for the flexible multibody system in a
conservative manner. through the nonlinear iterative correction and the
conservative projection, the developed fluid-flexible multibody interaction
solver is stable for problems involving strong inertial effects between the
fluid-flexible multibody system and the coupled interactions among each
multibody component. the accuracy of the proposed coupled finite element
framework is validated against the available experimental data for a long

"the effect of rotation on the classical gravity-driven rayleigh-taylor
instability has been shown to influence the scale of the perturbations that
develop at the unstable interface and consequently alter the speed of
propagation of the front. the present authors argued that this is as a result
of a competition between the destabilizing effect of gravity and the
stabilizing effect of the rotation. in the present paper we consider the
extreme limit of high rotation rates in which rotational forces dominate and
gravitational forces may be ignored. the two liquid layers initially form
concentric cylinders, centred on the axis of rotation. the configuration may be
thought of as a fluid-fluid centrifuge. there are two types of perturbation to
the interface that may be considered, an azimuthal perturbation around the
circumference of the interface and a varicose perturbation in the axial
direction along the length of the interface. it is the first of these types of
perturbation that we consider here, and so the flow may be considered

surface tension, and miscible fluid layers that may have some initial diffusion
of density. theoretical predictions are compared with numerical experiments and
the agreement is shown to be good. we do not restrict our analysis to equal

equations. both models account for shear-thinning but only the ptt model
accounts for elasticity. the cy and other generalised newtonian models have
been previously used in theoretical studies of fluid dampers, but the present
study is the first to perform full two-dimensional (axisymmetric) simulations
employing a viscoelastic constitutive equation. it is found that the cy and ptt
predictions are similar when the excitation frequency is low, but at medium and
higher frequencies the cy model fails to describe important phenomena that are
predicted by the ptt model and observed in experimental studies found in the
literature, such as the hysteresis of the force-displacement and force-velocity
loops. elastic effects are quantified by applying a decomposition of the damper
force into elastic and viscous components, inspired from laos (large amplitude
oscillatory shear) theory. the cy model also overestimates the damper force
relative to the ptt, because it underpredicts the flow development length
inside the piston-cylinder gap. it is thus concluded that (a) fluid elasticity
must be accounted for and (b) theoretical approaches that rely on the
assumption of one-dimensional flow in the piston-cylinder gap are of limited
accuracy, even if they account for fluid viscoelasticity. the consequences of
using lower-viscosity silicone oil are also briefly examined.

flows back to the heart. to prevent retrograde blood flow, the two intraluminal
leaflets meet in the center of the vein and occlude the vessel. in
fluid-structure interaction (fsi) simulations of venous valves, the large
structural displacements may lead to mesh deteriorations and entanglements,
causing instabilities of the solver and, consequently, the numerical solution
to diverge. in this paper, we propose an arbitrary lagrangian-eulerian (ale)
scheme for fsi simulations designed to solve these instabilities. a monolithic
formulation for the fsi problem is considered and, due to the complexity of the
operators, the exact jacobian matrix is evaluated using automatic
differentiation. the method relies on the introduction of a staggered in time
velocity %in the discretization scheme to improve stability, and on fictitious
springs to model the contact force of the valve leaflets. since the large
structural displacements may compromise the quality of the fluid mesh as well,
a smoother fluid displacement, obtained with the introduction of a scaling
factor that measures the distance of a fluid element from the valve leaflet
tip, guarantees that there are no mesh entanglements in the fluid domain. to
further improve stability, a streamline upwind petrov galerkin (supg) method is
employed. the proposed ale scheme is applied to a 2d model of a venous valve.
the presented simulations show that the proposed method deals well with the
large structural displacements of the problem, allowing a reconstruction of the
valve behavior in both the opening and closing phase.

"a kinetic theory of classical particles serves as a unified basis for
developing a geometric $3+1$ spacetime perspective on fluid dynamics capable of
embracing both minkowski and galilei/newton spacetimes. parallel treatment of
these cases on as common a footing as possible reveals that the particle
four-momentum is better regarded as comprising momentum and \textit{inertia}
rather than momentum and energy; and consequently, that the object now known as
the stress-energy or energy-momentum tensor is more properly understood as a
stress-\textit{inertia} or \textit{inertia}-momentum tensor. in dealing with
both fiducial and comoving frames as fluid dynamics requires, tensor
decompositions in terms of the four-velocities of observers associated with
these frames render use of coordinate-free geometric notation not only fully
viable, but conceptually simplifying. a particle number four-vector,
three-momentum $(1,1)$ tensor, and kinetic energy four-vector characterize a
simple fluid and satisfy balance equations involving spacetime divergences on
both minkowski and galilei/newton spacetimes. reduced to a fully $3+1$ form,
these equations yield the familiar conservative formulations of special
relativistic and non-relativistic hydrodynamics as partial differential
equations in inertial coordinates, and in geometric form will provide a useful
conceptual bridge to arbitrary-lagrange-euler and general relativistic
formulations.

"intermittency is a hallmark of turbulence, which exists not only in turbulent
flows of classical viscous fluids but also in flows of quantum fluids such as
superfluid $^4$he. despite the established similarity between turbulence in
classical fluids and quasi-classical turbulence in superfluid $^4$he, it has
been predicted that intermittency in superfluid $^4$he is temperature dependent
and enhanced for certain temperatures, which strikingly contrasts the nearly
flow-independent intermittency in classical turbulence. experimental
verification of this theoretical prediction is challenging since it requires
well-controlled generation of quantum turbulence in $^4$he and flow measurement
tools with high spatial and temporal resolution. here, we report an
experimental study of quantum turbulence generated by towing a grid through a
stationary sample of superfluid $^4$he. the decaying turbulent quantum flow is
probed by combining a recently developed he$^*_2$ molecular tracer-line tagging
velocimetry technique and a traditional second sound attenuation method. we
observe quasi-classical decays of turbulent kinetic energy in the normal fluid
and of vortex line density in the superfluid component. for several time
instants during the decay, we calculate the transverse velocity structure
functions. their scaling exponents, deduced using the extended self-similarity
hypothesis, display non-monotonic temperature-dependent intermittency
enhancement, in excellent agreement with recent theoretical/numerical study of
biferale et al. [phys. rev. fluids 3, 024605 (2018)].

"we present numerical simulations of laminar and turbulent channel flow of an
elastoviscoplastic fluid. the non-newtonian flow is simulated by solving the
full incompressible navier-stokes equations coupled with the evolution equation
for the elastoviscoplastic stress tensor. the laminar simulations are carried
out for a wide range of reynolds numbers, bingham numbers and ratios of the
fluid and total viscosity, while the turbulent flow simulations are performed
at a fixed bulk reynolds number equal to 2800 and weak elasticity. we show that
in the laminar flow regime the friction factor increases monotonically with the
bingham number (yield stress) and decreases with the viscosity ratio, while in
the turbulent regime the the friction factor is almost independent of the
viscosity ratio and decreases with the bingham number, until the flow
eventually returns to a fully laminar condition for large enough yield
stresses. three main regimes are found in the turbulent case, depending on the
bingham number: for low values, the friction reynolds number and the turbulent
flow statistics only slightly differ from those of a newtonian fluid; for
intermediate values of the bingham number, the fluctuations increase and the
inertial equilibrium range is lost. finally, for higher values the flow
completely laminarises. these different behaviors are associated with a
progressive increases of the volume where the fluid is not yielded, growing
from the centerline towards the walls as the bingham number increases. the
unyielded region interacts with the near-wall structures, forming
preferentially above the high speed streaks. in particular, the near-wall
streaks and the associated quasi-streamwise vortices are strongly enhanced in
an highly elastoviscoplastic fluid and the flow becomes more correlated in the
streamwise direction.

"fluid pressure and fluid velocity carry important information for cancer
diagnosis, prognosis and treatment. recent work has demonstrated that
estimation of these parameters is theoretically possible using ultrasound
poroelastography. however, accurate estimation of these parameters requires
high quality axial and lateral strain estimates from noisy ultrasound radio
frequency (rf) data. in this paper, we propose a filtering technique combining
two efficient filters for removal of noise from strain images, i.e., kalman and
nonlinear complex diffusion filters (ncdf). our proposed filter is based on a
novel noise model, which takes into consideration both additive and amplitude
modulation noise in the estimated strains. using finite element and ultrasound
simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed filtering technique can
significantly improve image quality of lateral strain elastograms along with
fluid pressure and velocity elastograms. technical feasibility of the proposed
method on an in vivo set of data is also demonstrated. our results show that
the cnre of the lateral strain, fluid pressure and fluid velocity as estimated
using the proposed technique is higher by at least 10.9%, 51.3% and 334.4% when
compared to the results obtained using a kalman filter only, by at least 8.9%,
27.6% and 219.5% when compared to the results obtained using a ncdf only and by
at least 152.3%, 1278% and 742% when compared to the results obtained using a

"we extend the classical two-fluid magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) formalism to
include quantum effects such as electron fermi pressure, bohm pressure and spin
couplings. at scales smaller than the electron skin-depth, the hall effect and
electron inertia must be taken into account, and can overlap with the quantum
effects. we write down the full set of two-fluid quantum mhd (qmhd) and analyze
the relative importance ofthese effects in the high density environments of
neutron star atmospheres and white dwarf interiors, finding that for a broad
range of parameters all these effects are operative. of all spin interactions
we analyze only the spin-magnetic coupling, as it is linear in $\hbar$ and
consequently it is the strongest spin effect. we re-obtain the classical
two-fluid mhd dispersion relations corresponding to the magnetosonic and
alfv\'en modes, modified by quantum effects. in the zero-spin case, for
propagation parallel to the magnetic field, we find that the frequency of the
fast mode is due to quantum effects modified by electron inertia, while the
frequency of the alfv\'en-slow sector has no quantum corrections. for
perpendicular propagation, the fast-mode frequency is the same as for the
parallel propagation plus a correction due only to classical two-fluid effects.
when spin is considered, a whistler mode appears, which is due to two-fluid
spin-magnetic interaction. there are no modifications due to spin for parallel
propagation of magnetosonic and alfv\'en waves, while for perpendicular prop
agation a dispersive term due to spin arises in the two-fluid expression for
the fast magnetosonic mode.

"the objective of this work is to investigate linear modal and algebraic
instability in poiseuille flows with fluids close to their vapour-liquid
critical point. close to this critical point, the ideal gas assumption does not
hold and large non-ideal fluid behaviours occur. as a representative non-ideal
fluid, we consider supercritical carbon dioxide (co$_2$) at pressure of 80 bar,
which is above its critical pressure of 73.9 bar. the poiseuille flow is
characterized by the reynolds number
($re=\rho_{w}^{*}u_{r}^{*}h^{*}/\mu_{w}^{*}$), the product of prandtl
($pr=\mu_{w}^{*}c_{pw}^{*}/\kappa_{w}^{*}$) and eckert number
($ec=u_{r}^{*2}/c_{pw}^{*}t_{w}^{*}$), and the wall temperature that in
addition to pressure determines the thermodynamic reference condition. for low
eckert numbers, the flow is essentially isothermal and no difference with the
well-known stability behaviour of incompressible flows is observed. however, if
the eckert number increases, the viscous heating causes gradients of
thermodynamic and transport properties, and non-ideal gas effects become
significant. three regimes of the laminar base flow can be considered,
subcritical (temperature in the channel is entirely below its pseudo-critical
value), transcritical, and supercritical temperature regime. if compared to the
linear stability of an ideal gas poiseuille flow, we show that the base flow is
more unstable in the subcritical regime, inviscid unstable in the transcritical
regime, while significantly more stable in the supercritical regime. following
the corresponding states principle, we expect that qualitatively similar
results will be obtained for other fluids at equivalent thermodynamic states.

"in our study we investigate the behaviour of the net force (nf) emerging
between an ellipsoidal particle and a thick plate (slab), when the interaction
takes place in a near critical fluid medium with account for the omnipresent
van der waals forces (vdwf). here we consider the case of complete wetting of
the objects surfaces by the medium, due to strong adsorbing local surface
potentials, exerted by thin solid coating films. the influence of the bulk
inner regions of the particle and the slab on the constituents of the fluid
results in long-ranged competing dispersion potentials. as a consequence from
the critical fluctuations of the medium, the system experiences an additional
effective interaction, traditionally termed critical casimir force (ccf). the
forces of interest are evaluated numerically from integral expressions obtained
utilizing general scaling arguments and mean-field type calculations in
combination with the so-called ""surface integration approach"" (sia). within the
scenario considered here, this technique is applicable if one has knowledge of
the forces between two parallel semi-infinite plates, confining in between some
fluctuating fluid medium characterized by its temperature $t$ and chemical
potential $\mu$. it is demonstrated that for a suitable set of particle-fluid,
slab-fluid, and fluid-fluid coupling parameters the competition between the
effects due to the coatings and the core regions of the objects result, when
one changes $t$ or $\mu$, in {\it sign change} of the nf acting between the
ellipsoid and the slab.

"hydro-mechanical processes in rough fractures are highly non-linear and
govern productivity and associated risks in a wide range of reservoir
engineering problems. to enable high-resolution simulations of hydro-mechanical
processes in fractures, we present an adaptation of an immersed boundary method
to compute fluid flow between rough fracture surfaces. the solid domain is
immersed into the fluid domain and both domains are coupled by means of
variational volumetric transfer operators. the transfer operators implicitly
resolve the boundary between the solid and the fluid, which simplifies the
setup of fracture simulations with complex surfaces. it is possible to choose
different formulations and discretization schemes for each subproblem and it is
not necessary to remesh the fluid grid. we use benchmark problems and real
fracture geometries to demonstrate the following capabilities of the presented
approach: (1) resolving the boundary of the rough fracture surface in the
fluid; (2) capturing fluid flow field changes in a fracture which closes under
increasing normal load; and (3) simulate the opening of a fracture due to
increased fluid pressure.

"in simple fluids, such as water, invariance under parity and time-reversal
symmetry imposes that the rotation of constituent 'atoms' are determined by the
flow and that viscous stresses damp motion. activation of the rotational
degrees of freedom of a fluid by spinning its atomic building blocks breaks
these constraints and has thus been the subject of fundamental theoretical
interest across classical and quantum fluids. however, the creation of a model
liquid which isolates chiral hydrodynamic phenomena has remained experimentally
elusive. here we report the creation of a cohesive two-dimensional chiral
liquid consisting of millions of spinning colloidal magnets and study its
flows. we find that dissipative viscous edge pumping is a key and general
mechanism of chiral hydrodynamics, driving uni-directional surface waves and
instabilities, with no counterpart in conventional fluids. spectral
measurements of the chiral surface dynamics reveal the presence of hall
viscosity, an experimentally long sought property of chiral fluids. precise
measurements and comparison with theory demonstrate excellent agreement with a
minimal but complete chiral hydrodynamic model, paving the way for the

"arabia terra is a region of mars where signs of past-water occurrence are
recorded in several landforms. broad and local scale geomorphological,
compositional and hydrological analyses point towards pervasive fluid
circulation through time. in this work we focus on mound fields located in the
interior of three casters larger than 40 km (firsoff, kotido and unnamed crater
20 km to the east) and showing strong morphological and textural resemblance to
terrestrial mud volcanoes and spring-related features. we infer that these
landforms likely testify the presence of a pressurized fluid reservoir at depth
and past fluid upwelling. we have performed morphometric analyses to
characterize the mound morphologies and consequently retrieve an accurate
automated mapping of the mounds within the craters for spatial distribution and
fractal clustering analysis. the outcome of the fractal clustering yields
information about the possible extent of the percolating fracture network at
depth below the craters. we have been able to constrain the depth of the
pressurized fluid reservoir between ~2.5 and 3.2 km of depth and hence, we
propose that mounds and mounds alignments are most likely associated to the
presence of fissure ridges and fluid outflow. their process of formation is
genetically linked to the formation of large intra-crater bulges previously
interpreted as large scale spring deposits. the overburden removal caused by
the impact crater formation is the inferred triggering mechanism for fluid
pressurization and upwelling, that through time led to the formation of the
intra-crater bulges and, after compaction and sealing, to the widespread mound
fields in their surroundings.

"strongly coupled dusty plasma medium is often described as a viscoelastic
fluid that retains its memory. in a flowing dusty plasma medium, vortices of
different sizes appear when the flow does not remain laminar. the vortices also
merge to transfer energy between different scales. in the present work, we
study the effect of viscoelasticity and compressibility over a localized vortex
structure and multiple rotational vortexes in a strongly coupled viscoelastic
dusty plasma medium. in case of single rotating vortex flow, a transverse wave
is generated from the localized vortex source and the evolution time of
generated waves is found to be reduced due to finite viscoelasticity and
compressibility of the medium. it is found that the viscoelasticity suppresses
the dispersion of vorticity. in the presence of multiple vortices, we find, the
vortex mergers get highly affected in the presence of memory effect of the
fluid, and thus the dynamics of the medium gets completely altered compared to
a non-viscoelastic fluid. for a compressible fluid, viscoelasticity damps out
the energy in the sonic waves generated in the medium. thus a highly
viscoelastic and compressible fluid, in some cases, behaves similarly to an
incompressible viscoelastic fluid. the wave-front like rings propagate in
elliptical orbits keeping the footprint of the earlier position of the
point-vortex. the rings collide with each other even within the patch vortex
region forming regions of high vorticity at the point of intersection and pass
through each other.

"gravitational collapse of a spherically symmetric homogeneous perfect
barotropic fluid with linear as well as polytropic type equation of state (eos)
has been investigated in the framework of a linear model of $f(r,t)$ gravity.
this modified gravity has the potential to explain the observed cosmic
acceleration. the calculations have been done taking the transformed time
coordinate $t \to \sqrt{\frac{\rho_0}{3}} t$, where $\rho_0$ is the initial
density of the fluid. for linear eos $p=\omega\rho$, the condition for being a
true singularity, along with sufficient condition for the formation of apparent
horizon covering the singularity has been derived. for a polytrope having the
eos $p=k\rho^{1+\frac{1}{n}}$, the scale factor ($a$) as a function of fluid
density ($\rho$) has been obtained which is then used to study the dynamics of
the fluid. role of the polytropic index ($n$) and the constant of
proportionality ($k$) in the dynamics of the fluid is also studied. a new type
of exotic matter field having varied dependence of scale factor on the density,

"the interplay between the structure and dynamics of partially confined
lennard jones (lj) fluids, deep into the supercritical phase, is studied over a
wide range of densities in the context of the frenkel line (fl), which
separates rigid liquidlike and non-rigid gaslike regimes in the phase diagram
of the supercritical fluids. extensive molecular dynamics simulations carried
out at the two ends of the fl (p = 5000 bars, t = 300 k, and t = 1500 k) reveal
intriguing features in supercritical fluids as a function of stiffness of the
partially confining atomistic walls. the liquidlike regime of a lj fluid (p =
5000 bars, t = 300 k), mimicking argon, partially confined between walls
separated by 10 {\aa} along the z-axis, and otherwise unconstrained, reveals
amorphous and liquidlike structural signatures in the radial distribution
function parallel to the walls and enhanced self-diffusion as the wall
stiffness is decreased. in sharp contrast, in the gas-like regime (p = 5000
bars, t = 1500 k), soft walls lead to increasing structural order hindering
self-diffusion. furthermore, the correlations between the structure and
self-diffusion are found to be well captured by excess entropy. the rich
behavior shown by supercritical fluids under partial confinement, even with
simple interatomic potentials, is found to be fairly independent of
hydrophilicity and hydrophobicity. the study identifies persisting
sub-diffusive features over intermediate time scales, emerging from the strong
interplay between density and confinement, to dictate the evolution and
stabilization of structures. it is anticipated that these results may help gain
a better understanding of the behavior of partially confined complex fluids

"we investigate the radial oscillations of small gas bubbles trapped in
yield-stress fluid and driven by an acoustic pressure field. we model the
rheological behavior of the yield-stress fluid using the recently developed
elasto-visco-plastic (evp) constitutive equation that takes into account the
elastic and visco-plastic deformations of the material [p. saramito, j.
nonnewton. fluid mech. 158 (1-3) (2009) pp.154-161]. assuming that the bubble
remains spherical during the pressure driving, we reduce the problem to a set
of odes and an integrodifferential equation, which we solve numerically for the
case of two yield-stress fluids, a sot carbopol gel and a stiffer kaolin
suspension. we find that, depending on the amplitude and frequency of the
pressure field, the radial oscillations of the bubble produce elastic stresses
that may or may not suffice to yield the surrounding material. we evaluate the
critical amplitude of the acoustic pressure required to achieve yielding and we
find a good agreement between numerical simulations and an analytical formula
derived under the assumption of linear deformations. finally, we examine the
bubble oscillation amplitude for a very wide range of applied pressures both
below and above the critical value to assess the impact of yielding on the
bubble dynamics. this analysis could be used to identify a signature of
yielding in experiments where the radial dynamics of a bubble is measured. more
generally, these results can be used to rationalize the optimal conditions for
pressure-induced bubble release from yield-stress fluids, which is relevant to
various biomedical and industrial applications, including oil industry and food

"the aim of this study is to develop a semi-analytical method to investigate
fluid-structure coupling of concentric double shells with different lengths and

functionally graded materials with mechanical properties changing through its
thickness continuously. the baffle made of steel is fixed along its top edge
and submerged inside fluid such that its lower edge freely moves. the developed
approach is verified using a commercial finite element computer code. although
the model is presented for a specific case in the present work, it can be
generalized to investigate coupling of shellplate structures via fluid. it is
shown that the coupling between concentric shells occurs only when they vibrate
in a same circumferential mode number, n. it is also revealed that the
normalized vibration amplitude of the inner shell is about the same as that of
the outer shell, for narrower radial gaps. moreover, the natural frequencies of
the fluid-coupled system gradually decrease and converge to the certain values

"in analysing fluid forces on a moving body, a natural approach is to seek a
component due to viscosity and an `inviscid' remainder. it is also attractive
to decompose the velocity field into irrotational and rotational parts, and
apportion the force resultants accordingly. the `irrotational' resultants can
then be identified as classical `added mass', but the remaining, `rotational',
resultants appear not to be consistent with the physical interpretation of the
rotational velocity field (as that arising from the fluid vorticity with the
body stationary). the alternative presented here splits the inviscid resultants
into components that are unquestionably due to independent aspects of the
problem: `convective' and `accelerative'. the former are associated with the
pressure field that would arise in an inviscid flow with (instantaneously) the
same velocities as the real one, and with the body's velocity parameters ---
angular and translational --- unchanging. the latter correspond to the pressure
generated when the body accelerates from rest in quiescent fluid with its given
rates of change of angular and translational velocity. they are reminiscent of
the added-mass force resultants, but are simpler, and closer to the standard
rigid-body inertia formulae, than the developed expressions for added-mass
force and moment. finally, the force resultants due to viscosity also include a
contribution from pressure. its presence is necessary in order to satisfy the
equations governing the pressure field, and it has previously been recognised
in the context of `excess' stagnation-point pressure. however, its existence
does not yet seem to be widely appreciated.

"fluid-structure interaction models involve parameters that describe the solid
and the fluid behavior. in simulations, there often is a need to vary these
parameters to examine the behavior of a fluid-structure interaction model for
different solids and different fluids. for instance, a shipping company wants
to know how the material, a ship's hull is made of, interacts with fluids at
different reynolds and strouhal numbers before the building process takes
place. also, the behavior of such models for solids with different properties
is considered before the prototype phase. a parameter-dependent linear
fluid-structure interaction discretization provides approximations for a bundle
of different parameters at one step. such a discretization with respect to
different material parameters leads to a big block-diagonal system matrix that
is equivalent to a matrix equation as discussed in [kressnertobler 2011]. the
unknown is then a matrix which can be approximated using a low-rank approach
that represents the iterate by a tensor. this paper discusses a low-rank gmres
variant and a truncated variant of the chebyshev iteration. bounds for the
error resulting from the truncation operations are derived. numerical
experiments show that such truncated methods applied to parameter-dependent

approaches.

"we measure the drag encountered by a vertically oriented rod moving across a
sedimented granular bed immersed in a fluid under steady-state conditions. at
low rod speeds, the presence of the fluid leads to a lower drag because of
buoyancy, whereas a significantly higher drag is observed with increasing
speeds. the drag as a function of depth is observed to decrease from being
quadratic at low speeds to appearing more linear at higher speeds. by scaling
the drag with the average weight of the grains acting on the rod, we obtain the
effective friction $\mu_e$ encountered over six orders of magnitude of speeds.
while a constant $\mu_e$ is found when the grain size, rod depth and fluid
viscosity are varied at low speeds, a systematic increase is observed as the
speed is increased. we analyze $\mu_e$ in terms of the inertial number $i$ and
viscous number $j$ to understand the relative importance of inertia and viscous
forces, respectively. for sufficiently large fluid viscosities, we find that
the effect of varying the speed, depth, and viscosity can be described by the
empirical function $\mu_e = \mu_o + k j^n$, where $\mu_o$ is the effective
friction measured in the quasi-static limit, and $k$ and $n$ are material
constants. the drag is then analyzed in terms of the effective viscosity
$\eta_e$ and found to decrease systematically as a function of $j$. we further
show that $\eta_e$ as a function of $j$ is directly proportional to the fluid
viscosity and the $\mu_e$ encountered by the rod.

"the dynamics of inertial particles in rayleigh-b\'{e}nard convection, where
both particles and fluid exhibit thermal expansion, is studied using direct
numerical simulations (dns). we consider the effect of particles with a thermal
expansion coefficient larger than that of the fluid, causing particles to
become lighter than the fluid near the hot bottom plate and heavier than the
fluid near the cold top plate. because of the opposite directions of the net
archimedes' force on particles and fluid, particles deposited at the plate now
experience a relative force towards the bulk. the characteristic time for this
motion towards the bulk to happen, quantified as the time particles spend
inside the thermal boundary layers (bls) at the plates, is shown to depend on
the thermal response time, $\tau_t$, and the thermal expansion coefficient of
particles relative to that of the fluid, $k = \alpha_p / \alpha_f$. in
particular, the residence time is constant for small thermal response times,
$\tau_t \lesssim 1$, and increasing with $\tau_t$ for larger thermal response
times, $\tau_t \gtrsim 1$. also, the thermal bl residence time is increasing
with decreasing $k$. a one-dimensional (1d) model is developed, where particles
experience thermal inertia and their motion is purely dependent on the buoyancy
force. although the values do not match one-to-one, this highly simplified 1d
model does predict a regime of a constant thermal bl residence time for smaller
thermal response times and a regime of increasing residence time with $\tau_t$
for larger response times, thus explaining the trends in the dns data well.

in this study, we numerically analyze the particle migration in stratified flow
of two liquids of different viscosities flowing parallel to each other between
two infinite parallel plates. particle migration in two different flow fields
is considered: (i) couette flow and (ii) poiseuille flow. a numerical approach
using an immersed boundary method is employed to perform two dimensional
simulations and determine conditions when particle migration from one fluid to
the other can occur. this has implications in separating particles from a fluid
without a membrane. the effect of the viscosity ratio, flowrate ratio, reynolds
number and particle size on focusing position are analyzed to identify
conditions under which the particle migrates from one fluid to the other. it is
shown that the particle migrates to the fluid with a lower viscosity in case of
stratified couette flow when the holdup of the low viscous fluid is
sufficiently high. in poiseuille flow, particle migrates to the less viscous
fluid beyond a critical flowrate ratio for a fixed viscosity ratio. this
critical flowrate ratio increases with particle size.

"in high head francis turbines and pump-turbines in particular, rotor stator
interaction (rsi) is an unavoidable source of excitation that needs to be
predicted accurately. precise knowledge of turbine dynamic characteristics,
notably the variation of the rotor natural frequencies with rotation speed and
added mass of the surrounding water, is essential to assess potential resonance
and resulting amplification of vibrations. in these machines, the disk-like
structures of the runner crown and band as well as the head cover and bottom
ring give rise to the emergence of diametrical modes and a mode split
phenomenon for which no efficient prediction method exists to date. fully
coupled fluid-structure interaction (fsi) methods are too computationally
expensive; hence, we seek a simplified modelling tool for the design and the

an analytical modal analysis based on the assumed mode approach and potential
flow theory, and a modal force computational fluid dynamics (cfd) approach for
rotating disks in dense fluid. both methods accurately predict the natural
frequency split as well as the natural frequency drift within 7.9% of the
values measured experimentally. the analytical model explains how mode split
and drift are respectively caused by linear and quadratic dependence of the
added mass with relative circumferential velocity between flexural waves and

"considering the high computation cost produced in conventional computation
fluid dynamic simulations, machine learning methods have been introduced to
flow dynamic simulations in recent years. however, most of studies focus mainly
on existing fluid fields learning, the prediction of spatio-temporal nonlinear
fluid flows in varying parameterized space has been neglected. in this work, we
propose a hybrid deep adversarial autoencoder (daa) to integrate generative
adversarial network (gan) and variational autoencoder (vae) for predicting
parameterized nonlinear fluid flows in spatial and temporal space.
high-dimensional inputs are compressed into the low-representation
representations by nonlinear functions in a convolutional encoder. in this way,
the predictive fluid flows reconstructed in a convolutional decoder contain the
dynamic flow physics of high nonlinearity and chaotic nature. in addition, the
low-representation representations are applied into the adversarial network for
model training and parameter optimization, which enables a fast computation
process. the capability of the hybrid daa is demonstrated by varying inputs on
a water collapse example. numerical results show that this hybrid daa has
successfully captured the spatio-temporal flow features with cpu speed-up of
three orders of magnitude. promising results suggests that the hybrid daa can
play a critical role in efficiently and accurately predicting complex flows in
future.

finite volume direct numerical simulation in the fluid domain. in the solid
domain, we solve the dynamic linear elasticity equations using a time-domain
finite element method. the obtained plate averaged displacement spectra
collapse in the low frequency region in outer scaling. however, the high
frequency spectral levels do not collapse in inner units. this spectral
behavior is reasoned using theoretical arguments. we further study the sources
of plate excitation using a novel formulation. this formulation expresses the
average displacement spectra of the plate as an integrated contribution from
the fluid sources within the channel. analysis of the net displacement source
reveals that at the plate natural frequencies, the contribution of the fluid
sources to the plate excitation peaks in the buffer layer. the corresponding
wall-normal width is found to be $\approx 0.75\delta$. we analyze the
decorrelated features of the sources using spectral proper orthogonal
decomposition (pod) of the net displacement source. we enforce the
orthogonality of the modes in an inner product with a symmetric positive
definite kernel. the dominant spectral pod mode contributes to the entire plate
excitation. the contribution of the remaining modes from the different
wall-normal regions undergo destructive interference resulting in zero net
contribution. the envelope of the dominant mode further shows that the location
and width of the contribution depend on inner and outer units, respectively.

"a rigid body accelerated through an inviscid, incompressible fluid appears to
gain mass, which is encoded in an added mass tensor. swimmers, air bubbles,
submarines and airships are slowed down by the associated `added mass' force
proportional to their acceleration, which is distinct from viscous drag and
buoyancy. in particle physics, otherwise massless electrons, quarks, $w$ and
$z$ bosons, moving through the higgs scalar field acquire masses encoded in a
mass matrix. in this expository article we give an introduction to the fluid
mechanical added mass effect through examples of potential flows in various
dimensions and exploit a correspondence with the higgs mechanism [introduced in
proc. r. soc. a471: 20140803 (2015)] to relate this to how the $w$ and $z$
bosons can get their masses, while leaving the photon massless. the
correspondence relates the higgs scalar field to the fluid, the vacuum
expectation value of the higgs field to a constant fluid density and quantum
fluctuations around the higgs condensate to compressional waves in the fluid.
the shape of the rigid body encodes the pattern of gauge symmetry breaking
through the eigenvalues of the corresponding mass matrices. possible directions
of acceleration of the rigid body are related to directions in the gauge lie
algebra with a `flat' direction in the body corresponding to a massless photon.
moreover, symmetries of the body are related to those of the scalar vacuum

open channel flow by means of direct numerical simulations with fully-resolved

whether the initial pattern wavelength scales with the particle diameter or
with the mean fluid height. a previous study (kidanemariam and uhlmann, j.
fluid mech., vol. 818, 2017, pp. 716-743) has observed a lower bound for the
most unstable pattern wavelength in the range 75-100 times the particle
diameter, which was equivalent to 3-4 times the mean fluid height. in the
current paper, we vary the streamwise box length in terms of the particle
diameter and of the mean fluid height independently in order to distinguish
between the two possible scaling relations. for the chosen parameter range, the
obtained results clearly exhibit a scaling of the initial pattern wavelength
with the particle diameter, with a lower bound around a streamwise extent of
approximately 80 particle diameters. in longer domains, on the other hand,
patterns are observed at initial wavelengths in the range 150-180 times the
particle diameter, which is in good agreement with experimental measurements.
variations of the mean fluid height, on the other hand, seem to have no
significant influence on the most unstable initial pattern wavelength.

spanwise and streamwise sediment waves of similar amplitude to evolve and

fluid/gravity correspondence. starting with a negative cosmological constant,
for each gauge, we derive the solution space and the residual gauge
diffeomorphisms. we construct explicitly the diffeomorphisms that relate the

show that bondi and fefferman--graham gauges are equivalent, while the
fluid/gravity derivative expansion, originating from a partial gauge fixing,
exhibits an extra unspecified function that encodes the boundary fluid

expansion's solution space, featuring a fluid in a specific hydrodynamic frame.
we pursue our analysis with the ricci-flat limit of the bondi gauge and of the

"synchronization of two actuated sheets serves as a simple model for the
interaction between flagellated microswimmers. various factors, including
inertia, sheet elasticity, and fluid viscoelasticity, have been suggested to
facilitate the synchronization of two sheets; however, the importance of
different contributions to this process still remains unclear. we perform a
systematic investigation of competing effects of inertia, sheet elasticity, and
fluid viscoelasticity on the synchronization of two sheets. characteristic time
$\tau^\mathrm{s}$ for the synchronization caused by inertial effects is
inversely proportional to sheet reynolds number $\mathrm{re}$, such that
$\tau^\mathrm{s} \omega \propto \mathrm{re}^{-1}$ with $\omega$ being the wave
frequency. synchronization toward stable in-phase or opposite-phase
configuration of two sheets is determined by the competition of inertial
effects, sheet elasticity, fluid compressibility and viscoelasticity.
interestingly, fluid viscoelasticity results in strong synchronization forces
for large beating amplitudes and deborah numbers $\mathrm{de} > 1$, which
dominates over other factors and favors the in-phase configuration. therefore,
our results show that fluid viscoelasticity can dramatically enhance
synchronization of microswimmers. our investigation deciphers the importance of

models are considered to investigate prototypes before they are physically
assembled. how a material interacts with different fluids at different reynold
numbers has to be studied before it is passed over to the manufacturing
process. in addition, examining the same model not only for different fluids
but also for different solids allows to optimize the choice of materials for
construction even better. a possible answer on this demand is
parameter-dependent discretization. furthermore, low-rank techniques can reduce
the complexity needed to compute approximations to parameter-dependent
fluid-structure interaction discretizations.
  low-rank methods have been applied to parameter-dependent linear
fluid-structure interaction discretizations. the linearity of the operators
involved allows to translate the resulting equations to a single matrix
equation. the solution is approximated by a low-rank method. in this paper, we
propose a new method that extends this framework to nonlinear
parameter-dependent fluid-structure interaction problems by means of the newton
iteration. the parameter set is split into disjoint subsets. on each subset,
the newton approximation of the problem related to the upper median parameter
is computed and serves as initial guess for one newton step on the whole
subset. this newton step yields a matrix equation whose solution can be
approximated by a low-rank method.
  the resulting method requires a smaller number of newton steps if compared
with a direct approach that applies the newton iteration to the separate
problems consecutively. in the experiments considered, the proposed method
allowed to compute a low-rank approximation within a twentieth of the time used

"the aim of this work is to investigate to what extent the structural
properties of a short-range square-well (sw) fluid of range $\lambda$ at a
given packing fraction and reduced temperature can be represented by those of a
sticky-hard-sphere (shs) fluid at the same packing fraction and an effective
stickiness parameter $\tau$. such an equivalence cannot hold for the radial
distribution function since this function has a delta singularity at contact in
the shs case, while it has a jump discontinuity at $r=\lambda$ in the sw case.
therefore, the equivalence is explored with the cavity function $y(r)$.
optimization of the agreement between $y_{\sw}$ and $y_{\shs}$ to first order
in density suggests the choice for $\tau$. we have performed monte carlo (mc)
simulations of the sw fluid for $\lambda=1.05$, 1.02, and 1.01 at several
densities and temperatures $t^*$ such that $\tau=0.13$, 0.2, and 0.5. the
resulting cavity functions have been compared with mc data of shs fluids
obtained by miller and frenkel [j. phys: cond. matter 16, s4901 (2004)].
although, at given values of $\eta$ and $\tau$, some local discrepancies
between $y_{\sw}$ and $y_{\shs}$ exist (especially for $\lambda=1.05$), the sw
data converge smoothly toward the shs values as $\lambda-1$ decreases. the
approximate mapping $y_{\sw}\to y_{\shs}$ is exploited to estimate the internal
energy and structure factor of the sw fluid from those of the shs fluid. taking
for $y_{\shs}$ the solution of the percus--yevick equation as well as the
rational-function approximation, the radial distribution function $g(r)$ of the
sw fluid is theoretically estimated and a good agreement with our mc
simulations is found. finally, a similar study is carried out for short-range
sw fluid mixtures.

"hydrodynamics can be consistently formulated on surfaces of arbitrary
co-dimension in a background space-time, providing the effective theory
describing long-wavelength perturbations of black branes. when the co-dimension
is non-zero, the system acquires fluid-elastic properties and constitutes what
is called a fluid brane. applying an effective action approach, the most
general form of the free energy quadratic in the extrinsic curvature and
extrinsic twist potential of stationary fluid brane configurations is
constructed to second order in a derivative expansion. this construction
generalizes the helfrich-canham bending energy for fluid membranes studied in
theoretical biology to the case in which the fluid is rotating. it is found
that stationary fluid brane configurations are characterized by a set of 3
elastic response coefficients, 3 hydrodynamic response coefficients and 1 spin
response coefficient for co-dimension greater than one. moreover, the elastic
degrees of freedom present in the system are coupled to the hydrodynamic
degrees of freedom. for co-dimension-1 surfaces we find a 8 independent
parameter family of stationary fluid branes. it is further shown that elastic
and spin corrections to (non)-extremal brane effective actions can be accounted
for by a multipole expansion of the stress-energy tensor, therefore
establishing a relation between the different formalisms of carter,
capovilla-guven and vasilic-vojinovic and between gravity and the effective
description of stationary fluid branes. finally, it is shown that the young
modulus found in the literature for black branes falls into the class predicted
by this approach - a relation which is then used to make a proposal for the
second order effective action of stationary blackfolds and to find the
corrected horizon angular velocity of thin black rings.

"this paper presents a theoretical study of a non-linear rheological fluid
transport in an axisymmetric tube by cilia. however, an attempt has been made
to explain the role of cilia motion on the transport of fluid through the
ductus efferentes of the male reproductive tract. ostwald-de waele power-law
viscous fluid has been considered to represent the rheological fluid. to
analyze pumping by means of a sequence of beat of cilia from row-to-row of
cilia in a given row of cells and from one row of cells to the next
(metachronal wave movement), we consider the conditions that the corresponding
reynolds number is small enough for inertial effects to be negligible and the
wavelength to diameter ratio is large enough for the pressure to be considered
uniform over the cross-section. analyses and computations of the detailed fluid
motion reveal that the time-averaged flow rate is dependent on $\epsilon$, a
non-dimensional measure involving the mean radius $a$ of the tube and the cilia
length. thus, flow rate significantly varies with the cilia length. moreover,
the flow rate has been reported near to the estimated value $6\times
10^{-3}$$ml/h$ for human efferent ducts if $\epsilon$ is near by 0.4. the
estimated value was suggested by lardner and shack [1] in human, based on the
experimental observations for flow rates in efferent ducts of other animals,
e.g., rat, ram and bull. in addition, the nature of the rheological fluid,
i.e., the value of the fluid index $n$ strongly influences various
flow-governed characteristics. the interesting feature of the paper is that the
pumping improves with the thickening behavior for small values of $\epsilon$ or

"we present an experimental investigation of the dynamics and flow-coupling of
convective turbulent flows in a cylindrical rayleigh-benard convection cell
with two immiscible fluids, water and fluorinert fc-77 electronic liquid
(fc77). it is found that one large-scale circulation (lsc) roll exists in each
of the fluid layers, and that their circulation planes have two preferred
azimuthal orientations separated by $\sim\pi$. a surprising finding of the
study is that cessations/reversals of the lsc in fc77 of the two-layer system
occur much more frequently than they do in single-layer turbulent rbc, and that
a cessation is most likely to result in a flow reversal of the lsc, which is in
sharp contrast with the uniform distribution of the orientational angular
change of the lsc before and after cessations in single-layer turbulent rbc.
this implies that the dynamics governing cessations and reversals in the two
systems are very different. two coupling modes, thermal coupling (flow
directions of the two lscs are opposite to each other at the fluid-fluid
interface) and viscous coupling (flow directions of the two lscs are the same
at the fluid-fluid interface), are identified with the former one as the
predominant mode. that most cessations (in the fc77 layer) end up as reversals
can be understood as a symmetry breaking imposed by the orientation of the lsc
in the water layer, which remained unchanged most of the time. furthermore, the
frequently occurring cessations and reversals are caused by the system
switching between its two metastable states, i.e. thermal and viscous coupling
modes. it is also observed that the strength of the lsc in water becomes weaker
when the lsc in fc77 rotates faster azimuthally and that the flow strength in
fc77 becomes stronger when the lsc in water rotates faster azimuthally, i.e.
the influence of the lsc in one fluid layer on the other is not symmetric.

"in steady sediment transport, sediment deposition is balanced by entrainment
of bed particles by fluid forces or particle-bed impacts. here we propose a
proxy to determine the role of impact entrainment relative to entrainment by
the mean turbulent flow: the ""bed velocity"" $v_b$, which is an effective
near-bed-surface value of the average horizontal particle velocity that
generalizes the classical slip velocity, used in studies of aeolian saltation
transport, to sediment transport in an arbitrary newtonian fluid. we study
$v_b$ for a wide range of the particle-fluid-density ratio $s$, galileo number
$\mathrm{ga}$, and shields number $\theta$ using direct sediment transport
simulations. we find that transport is fully sustained through impact
entrainment (i.e., $v_b$ is constant in natural units) when the ""impact number""
$\mathrm{im}=\mathrm{ga}\sqrt{s+0.5}\gtrsim20$ or $\theta\gtrsim5/\mathrm{im}$.
these conditions are obeyed for the vast majority of transport regimes,
including steady turbulent bedload, which has long been thought to be sustained
solely through fluid entrainment. in fact, we find that transport is fully
sustained through fluid entrainment (i.e., $v_b$ scales with the near-bed
horizontal fluid velocity) only for sufficiently viscous bedload transport at
grain scale (i.e., for $\mathrm{im}\lesssim20$ and
$\theta\lesssim1/\mathrm{im}$). finally, we do not find a strong correlation
between, $v_b$, or the classical slip velocity, and the
transport-layer-averaged horizontal particle velocity $\overline{v_x}$, which
challenges the long-standing consensus that predominant impact entrainment is
responsible for a linear scaling of the transport rate with $\theta$. for
turbulent bedload in particular, $\overline{v_x}$ increases with $\theta$
despite $v_b$ remaining constant, which we propose is linked to the formation
of a liquid-like bed on top of the static-bed surface.

compressible navier-stokes equations about an arbitrary state (assuming the
fluid is barotropic), and so the fluid pde component of the interaction will
generally include a nontrivial ambient flow profile $ \mathbf{u}$. the
appearance of this term introduces new challenges at the level of the
stationary problem. in addition, the boundary of the fluid domain is
unavoidably lipschitz, and so the well-posedness argument takes into account
the technical issues associated with obtaining necessary boundary trace and
elliptic regularity estimates. much of the previous work on flow-plate models
was done via galerkin-type constructions after obtaining good a priori
estimates on solutions (specifically \cite {chu2013-comp}---the work most
pertinent to ours here); in contrast, we adopt here a lumer-phillips approach,
with a view of associating solutions of the fluid-structure dynamics with a
$c_{0}$-semigroup $\left\{ e^{ \mathcal{a}t}\right\} _{t\geq 0}$ on the natural
finite energy space of initial data. so, given this approach, the major
challenge in our work becomes establishing of the maximality of the operator
$\mathcal{a}$ which models the fluid-structure dynamics. in sum: our main
result is semigroup well-posedness for the fully coupled fluid-structure
dynamics, under the assumption that the ambient flow field $ \mathbf{u}\in

considerable confusions in visualizing and understanding the coherent vortical
structures in turbulence. according to previous study, it is realized that
vortex is not the vorticity tube and vorticity should be decomposed into a
rotational part which is the vortex vector and a non-rotational part which is
the shear. in this paper, several new concepts such as fluid rotation of local
point, the direction of fluid rotation axis and the strength of fluid rotation
are proposed by investigating the kinematics of fluid element in the 2d and 3d

to describe the local fluid rotation. the direction of the vortex vector is
defined as the direction of local fluid rotation axis. the velocity components
in the plane orthogonal to the vortex vector have zero derivatives along the

rotational part of vorticity in the direction of the vortex vector, which is
the twice of the minimum angular velocity of fluid around the point among all
azimuth in the plane perpendicular to vortex vector. according to the
definition of the vortex vector, vortex is defined as a connected flow region
where the magnitude of the vortex vector at each point is larger than zero. the
new definition for the vortex vector and vortex follows three principles: 1.

carrying a fluid allows an alternative formulation, reducing to a single
compact equation for the back-to-labels map instead of three conservation
equations. that single equation shows interesting instability in solutions when
the vorticity exceeds a certain threshold. furthermore, the equation in stable

increasing $re^*$. the second objective of this study is to explore the change
in flow in the presence of particles. almost neutrally-buoyant finite-size
spherical particles with duct height, $2h$, to particle diameter, $d_p$, ratio
of 12 are used at two volume fractions $\phi$ = 5 and 10\%. particle tracking
velocimetry (ptv) is used to measure the velocity of these
refractive-index-matched spheres, and piv to extract the fluid velocity. simple
shadowgraphy is also used for qualitatively visualising the development of the
particle distribution along the streamwise direction. the particle distribution
pattern changes from being concentrated at the four corners, at low flow rates,
to being focussed along a diffused ring between the center and the corners, at
high flow rates. the presence of particles induces streamwise and wall-normal
velocity fluctuations in the fluid phase; however, the primary reynolds shear
stress is still very small compared to turbulent flows. the size of the plug in
the particle-laden cases appears to be smaller than the corresponding single
phase cases. similar to newtonian fluids, the friction factor increases due to
the presence of particles, almost independently of the suspending fluid matrix.

agrees quite well with the experimental friction factor for the concentrations

"deep learning techniques for improving fluid flow modelling have gained
significant attention in recent years. advanced deep learning techniques
achieve great progress in rapidly predicting fluid flows without prior
knowledge of the underlying physical relationships. advanced deep learning
techniques achieve great progress in rapidly predicting fluid flows without
prior knowledge of the underlying physical relationships. however, most of
existing researches focused mainly on either sequence learning or spatial
learning, rarely on both spatial and temporal dynamics of fluid flows
(reichstein et al., 2019). in this work, an artificial intelligence (ai) fluid
model based on a general deep convolutional generative adversarial network
(dcgan) has been developed for predicting spatio-temporal flow distributions.
in deep convolutional networks, the high-dimensional flows can be converted
into the low-dimensional ""latent"" representations. the complex features of flow
dynamics can be captured by the adversarial networks. the above dcgan fluid
model enables us to provide reasonable predictive accuracy of flow fields while
maintaining a high computational efficiency. the performance of the dcgan is
illustrated for two test cases of hokkaido tsunami with different incoming
waves along the coastal line. it is demonstrated that the results from the
dcgan are comparable with those from the original high fidelity model
(fluidity). the spatio-temporal flow features have been represented as the flow
evolves, especially, the wave phases and flow peaks can be captured accurately.
in addition, the results illustrate that the online cpu cost is reduced by five
orders of magnitude compared to the original high fidelity model simulations.
the promising results show that the dcgan can provide rapid and reliable
spatio-temporal prediction for nonlinear fluid flows.

"we derive expressions for the leading-order far-field flows generated by
mobile colloids trapped at planar fluid-fluid interfaces. we consider both
externally driven colloids and active colloids (swimmers) either adjacent to or
adhered to the interface. in the latter case, we assume a pinned contact line.
the reynolds and capillary numbers are assumed much less than unity, in line
with typical micron-scale colloids involving air- or alkane-aqueous interfaces.
at clean (surfactant-free) interfaces, the hydrodynamic modes are essentially a
restricted set of the usual stokes multipoles in a bulk fluid. to leading
order, driven colloids simply exert stokelets parallel to the interface, while
active colloids drive different kinds of fluid motion depending on their
orientation with respect to the interface. we then consider how these modes are
altered by the presence of an incompressible surfactant layer, which occurs at
high marangoni numbers. this limiting behavior is typical for colloidal systems
at small capillary numbers, even when scant surfactant is present. compared to
a clean interface, incompressibility substantially constrains flow directed
normal to the interface. for both driven and active colloids, this flow arises
only from asymmetry of the colloid geometry or boundary motion with respect to
the interfacial plane. the flow parallel to the interface is also restructured
dramatically. moreover, surface-viscous stresses, if present, potentially
generate very long-ranged flow on the interface and the surrounding fluids. we
examine the limiting forms of such flows. our results have important
implications for colloid assembly and advective mass transport enhancement near
fluid boundaries.

"an attractive method of obtaining an effective cosmological constant at the
present epoch is through the potential energy of a scalar field. considering
models with a perfect fluid and a scalar field, we classify all potentials for
which the scalar field energy density scales as a power-law of the scale factor
when the perfect fluid density dominates. there are three possibilities. the
first two are well known; the much-investigated exponential potentials have the
scalar field mimicking the evolution of the perfect fluid, while for negative
power-laws, introduced by ratra and peebles, the scalar field density grows
relative to that of the fluid. the third possibility is a new one, where the
potential is a positive power-law and the scalar field energy density decays
relative to the perfect fluid. we provide a complete analysis of exact
solutions and their stability properties, and investigate a range of possible
cosmological applications.

"various classification schemes exist for homogeneous and isotropic (cp) world
models, which include pressureless matter (so-called dust) and einstein's
cosmological constant lambda. we here classify the solutions of more general
world models consisting of up to four non-interacting fluids, each with
pressure p, energy density epsilon and an equation of state p = (gamma - 1)
epsilon with 0 <= gamma <= 2.
  in addition to repulsive fluids with negative pressure and positive energy
density, which generalize the classical repulsive (positive) lambda component,
we consider fluids with negative energy density as well. the latter generalize
a negative lambda component. this renders possible new types of models that do
not occur among the classical classifications of world models. singularity-free
periodic solutions as well as further `hill-type', `hollow-type' and
`shifting-type' models are feasible.
  however, if one only allows for three components (dust, radiation and one
repulsive component) in a spatially flat universe the repulsive classical
lambda fluid (with lambda > 0) tends to yield the smoothest fits of the
supernova ia data from perlmutter et al. (1999). adopting the sn ia
constraints, exotic negative energy density components can be fittingly
included only if the universe consists of four or more fluids.

"this review starts with a discussion of the hierarchy of scales, relevant to
the description of superfluids in neutron stars, which motivates a subsequent
elementary exposition of the newtonian superfluid hydrodynamics. starting from
the euler equations for a superfluid and a normal fluid we apply the tensor
virial method to obtain the virial equations of the first, second, and third
order and to compute their eulerian perturbations. special emphasis is put on
the computation of perturbations of the new terms due to mutual gravitational
attraction and mutual friction between the two fluids. the oscillation modes of
superfluid maclaurin spheroids are derived from the first and second order
perturbed virial equations. we discuss two generic classes of oscillation modes
which correspond to the co-moving and relative oscillations of two fluids.
these modes decouple if the normal fluid is inviscid. we also discuss the
mixing of these modes (when the normal fluid is viscous) and its effect on the
dynamical and secular instabilities of the co-moving modes and their damping.

r-modes in the shell of an incompressible fluid. different r-modes with $\ell$

secular effects for the motion of a fluid element in the shell undergoing

"the description of a stellar system as a continuous fluid represents a
convenient first approximation to stellar dynamics, and its derivation from the
kinetic theory is standard. the challenge lies in providing adequate closure
approximations for the higher-order moments of the phase-space density function
that appear in the fluid dynamical equations. such closure approximations may
be found using representations of the phase-space density as embodied in the
kinetic theory. in the classic approach of chapman and enskog, one is led to
the navier-stokes equations, which are known to be inaccurate when the mean
free paths of particles are long, as they are in many stellar systems. to
improve on the fluid description, we derive here a modified closure relation
using a fokker-planck collision operator. to illustrate the nature of our
approximation, we apply it to the study of gravitational instability. the
instability proceeds in a qualitative manner as given by the navier-stokes
equations but, in our description, the damped modes are considerably closer to
marginality, especially at small scales.

"we demonstrate a close analogy between a viscoelastic medium and an
electrically conducting fluid containing a magnetic field. specifically, the
dynamics of the oldroyd-b fluid in the limit of large deborah number
corresponds to that of a magnetohydrodynamic (mhd) fluid in the limit of large
magnetic reynolds number. as a definite example of this analogy, we compare the
stability properties of differentially rotating viscoelastic and mhd flows. we
show that there is an instability of the oldroyd-b fluid that is physically
distinct from both the inertial and elastic instabilities described previously
in the literature, but is directly equivalent to the magnetorotational
instability in mhd. it occurs even when the specific angular momentum increases
outwards, provided that the angular velocity decreases outwards; it derives
from the kinetic energy of the shear flow and does not depend on the curvature
of the streamlines. however, we argue that the elastic instability of
viscoelastic couette flow has no direct equivalent in mhd.

{\em never} formed. when both of them are present, black holes can be formed,
due to the condensation of the dust fluid. initially the dust fluid may not
play an important role, but, as time increases, it will dominate the collapse
and finally leads to formation of black holes. this result remains true even
when the interaction between the dust fluid and dark energy does not vanish.
when $w < -1$ (phantoms), some models can also be interpreted as representing
the death of a white hole that ejects both dust and phantoms. the ejected

of both dark components remains unknown, it is interesting to consider other

"symmetric binary fluids, quenched into a regime of immiscibility, undergo
phase separation by spinodal decomposition. in the late stages, the fluids are
separated by sharply defined, but curved, interfaces: the resulting laplace

that, ultimately, this flow should become turbulent as inertial effects
dominate over viscous ones. the physics here is complex: mesoscale simulation
methods (such as lattice boltzmann and dissipative particle dynamics) can play
an essential role in its elucidation, as we describe. likewise, it is a matter
of experience that immiscible fluids will mix, on some lengthscale at least, if
stirred vigorously enough. a scaling theory (of doi and ohta) predicts the
dependence of a steady state domain size on shear rate, but assumes low
reynolds number (inertia is neglected). our preliminary simulation results
(three-dimensional, so far only on small systems) show little sign of the kind

the first analytical description of anomalous scaling laws in turbulence has

of a group and the change of its geometry. by breaking the scale-invariance

results for the case when the dielectric contrasts of some particles can be

the critical temperature, and the critical density, of the fluid
1,1-difluoroethylene. lorentz-lorenz coefficient data were obtained by
measuring refractive index and density of the same fluid sample independently
of one another. accurate determination of the lorentz-lorenz coefficient is
necessary for transformation of refractive index data into density data from
optics-based experiments on critical phenomena of fluid systems done with
different apparatus, with which independent measurement of the refractive indes
and density is not possible. measurements were made along the coexistence curve
of the fluid and span the density range 0.01 to 0.80 g/cc. the lorentz-lorenz
coefficient results show a stronger density dependence along the coexistence
curve than previously observed in other fluids, with a monotonic decrease from
a density of about 0.2 g/cc onwards, and an overall variation of about 2.5% in
the density range studied. no anomaly in the lorentz-lorenz coefficient was
observed near the critical density. the critical temperature is measured at

known to adsorb irreversibly to the fluid-fluid interface. we present
large-scale computer simulations of the demixing of a binary solvent containing

as the interface coarsens, the particles are forced into close contact by
interfacial tension. coarsening is dramatically curtailed, and the jammed
colloidal layer seemingly enters a glassy state, creating a multiply connected,
solid-like film in three dimensions. the resulting gel contains percolating

"we present a numerical study of the structural correlations associated to gas
adsorption/desorption in silica aerogels in order to provide a theoretical
interpretation of scattering experiments. following our earlier work, we use a

behavior of the adsorbed gas within a local mean-field analysis.
  we focus on the differences between the adsorption and desorption mechanisms
and their signature in the fluid-fluid and gel-fluid structure factors as a
function of temperature. at low temperature, but still in the regime where the
isotherms are continuous, we find that the adsorbed fluid density, during both
filling and draining, is correlated over distances that may be much larger than
the gel correlation length. in particular, extended fractal correlations may
occur during desorption, indicating the existence of a ramified cluster of
vapor filled cavities. this also induces an important increase of the
scattering intensity at small wave vectors. the similarity and differences with
the scattering of fluids in other porous solids such as vycor are discussed.

"using classical density functional theory (dft) the effect of bringing a
liquid crystal (lc) into contact with a porous substrate or matrix is
investigated. the dft used is a combination of the onsager approximation to
evaluate the excess free energy of the lc fluid and quenched annealed dft to
evaluate the interaction between the fluid and the porous substrate. when the
fluid alignment far from the substrate is held perpendicular to its surface
there is a thin layer of fluid aligned parallel to the substrate surface for
low matrix densities. for higher matrix densities this director deformation
propagates into the bulk of the fluid. consideration of a system without
confining walls suggests that for low matrix densities normal alignment is
metastable compared to parallel alignment, while for higher matrix densities it
is unstable.

brownian motion. the stochastic dynamics of two adjacent cantilevers are
correlated due to long range effects of the viscous fluid. using a recently
proposed thermodynamic approach the hydrodynamic correlations are quantified
for precise experimental conditions through deterministic numerical
simulations. results are presented for an array of two readily available atomic
force microscope cantilevers. it is shown that the force on a cantilever due to
the fluid correlations with an adjacent cantilever is more than 3 times smaller
than the brownian force on an individual cantilever. our results indicate that

inelastic x-ray scattering. in spite of the markedly supercritical conditions

the comparison of the present results with literature data obtained in several

line in the ($p/p_c$, $t/t_c$) plane as the relevant edge between liquid- and

  all disks have some common features: surface energy density and pressures
decrease monotonically and rapidly with radius. as the ``cut'' parameter $a$
decreases, the disks become more relativistic, with surface energy density and
pressure more concentrated near the center. also regions of unstable circular
orbits are more likely to appear for high relativistic disks. parameters can be
chosen so that the sound velocity in the fluid and the tangential velocity of

there is a suitable choice of coordinates on the equatorial slice through a

"in this thesis four separate problems in general relativity are considered,
divided into two separate themes: coordinate conditions and perfect fluid
spheres. regarding coordinate conditions we present a pedagogical discussion of
how the appropriate use of coordinate conditions can lead to simplifications in

seeking specific exact solutions of the einstein equations. regarding perfect
fluid spheres we present several methods of transforming any given perfect
fluid sphere into a possibly new perfect fluid sphere. this is done in three
qualitatively distinct manners: the first set of solution generating theorems
apply in schwarzschild curvature coordinates, and are phrased in terms of the
metric components: they show how to transform one static spherical perfect
fluid spacetime geometry into another. a second set of solution generating
theorems extends these ideas to other coordinate systems (such as isotropic,
gaussian polar, buchdahl, synge, and exponential coordinates), again working
directly in terms of the metric components. finally, the solution generating

particular the current is zero if it is a maxwell gauge field, and it is
maximal if it is a chern-simons gauge field. there is an intermediate behaviour
in presence of both maxwell and chern-simons term. therefore it appears that

"this paper is an investigation of the effects of a thermal bulk fluid in

such a fluid changes the bulk dynamics and to compare these effects with those

solution for a thermally excited massless bulk field, as well as perturbative
solutions with matter on the brane and in the bulk. we then perturb around
these solutions to find solutions for a massive bulk mode in the limit where
the bulk mass (m_b) is small compared to the ads curvature scale and t< m_b. we
find that without a stabilizing potential there are no physical solutions for a
thermal bulk fluid. we then include a stabilizing potential and calculate the

adopted in which the original system is converted to a local gauge theory and
is embedded in a {\it canonical} extended phase space. in a different reduced
phase space scheme \cite{vy} also the original model is converted to a gauge
theory and subsequently the two distinct gauge invariant formulations of the

the tachyon matter encodes the average effect of high frequency oscillations
turned on those strings. in particular, the combined fluid system has been
known to have a reduced speed of light, depending on the composition, and we

counterexample to this bound can be constructed from a nonrelativistic gas by
increasing the number of species in the fluid while keeping the dynamics
essentially independent of the species type. the question of whether the
underlying structure of relativistic quantum field theory generically inhibits
the realization of such a system and thereby preserves the possibility of a
universal bound is considered here. using rather conservative assumptions, it
is shown here that a metastable gas of heavy mesons in a particular controlled
regime of qcd provides a realization of the counterexample and is consistent
with a well-defined underlying relativistic quantum field theory. thus, quantum

straight, the fluid adopts the parabolic velocity profile of poiseuille flow;
the spread of any contaminant along the pipe is then described by the shear
dispersion model of taylor (1954) and its refinements by mercer, watt et al
(1994,1996). however, two conflicting effects occur in a generally curving
pipe: viscosity skews the velocity profile which enhances the shear dispersion;
whereas in faster flow centrifugal effects establish secondary flows that
reduce the shear dispersion. the two opposing effects cancel at a reynolds
number of about 15. interestingly, the torsion of the pipe seems to have very
little effect upon the flow or the dispersion, the curvature is by far the

"at equilibrium, a fluid element, within a larger heat bath, receives random
impulses from the bath. those impulses, which induce stochastic transitions in
the system (the fluid element), respect the principle of detailed balance,
because the bath is also at equilibrium. under continuous shear, the fluid
element adopts a non-equilibrium steady state. because the surrounding bath of
fluid under shear is also in a non-equilibrium steady state, the system
receives stochastic impulses with a non-equilibrium distribution. those
impulses no longer respect detailed balance, but are nevertheless constrained
by rules. the rules in question, which are applicable to a wide sub-class of
driven steady states, were recently derived [r. m. l. evans, phys. rev. lett.

fundamental derivation, based on the uncontroversial, non-bayesian
interpretation of probabilities as simple ratios of countable quantities. we
apply the results to some simple models of interacting particles, to
investigate the nature of forces that are mediated by a non-equilibrium

equations turn out to be those of boundary fluid dynamics, with specific values
for fluid parameters. our analysis is perturbative in the boundary derivative

surface compressible flow between two fluids, typically air and water. we use a
two fluid model with the same velocity, pressure and temperature for both
phases. in such a numerical model, the free surface becomes a thin three
dimensional zone. the present method has at least three advantages: (i) the
free-surface treatment is completely implicit; (ii) it can naturally handle
wave breaking and other topological changes in the flow; (iii) one can easily
vary the equation of states (eos) of each fluid (in principle, one can even
consider tabulated eos). moreover, our model is unconditionally hyperbolic for
reasonable eos.

"the flow resulting from a strong ultrarelativistic shock moving through a
stellar envelope with a polytrope-like density profile has been studied
analytically and numerically at early times while the fluid temperature is
relativistic--that is, just before and just after the shock breaks out of the
star. such a flow should expand and accelerate as its internal energy is
converted to bulk kinetic energy; at late enough times, the assumption of
relativistic temperatures becomes invalid. here we present a new self-similar
solution for the post-breakout flow when the accelerating fluid has bulk
kinetic lorentz factors much larger than unity but is cooling through $p/n$ of
order unity to subrelativistic temperatures. this solution gives a relation
between a fluid element's terminal lorentz factor and that element's lorentz
factor just after it is shocked. our numerical integrations agree well with the
solution. while our solution assumes a planar flow, we show that corrections
due to spherical geometry are important only for extremely fast ejecta
originating in a region very close to the stellar surface. this region grows if
the shock becomes relativistic deeper in the star.

heavy fluid falls under the action of gravity through a light one. we consider
this phenomenon accompanied by a reactive transformation between the fluids,
and study with direct numerical simulations (dns) how the reaction (flame)
affects the turbulent mixing in the boussinesq approximation. we discuss ""slow""
reactions where the characteristic reaction time exceeds the temporal scale of
the rt instability. in the early turbulent stage, effects of the flame are
distributed over a maturing mixing zone, whose development is weakly influenced
by the reaction. at later times, the fully mixed zone transforms into a
conglomerate of pure-fluid patches of sizes proportional to the mixing zone
width. in this ""stirred flame'' regime, temperature fluctuations are consumed
by reactions in the regions separating the pure-fluid patches. this dns-based
qualitative description is followed by a phenomenology suggesting that thin

"when particulate suspensions are sheared, perturbations in the shear flows
around the rigid particles increase the local energy dissipation, so that the
viscosity of the suspension is effectively higher than that of the solvent. for
bulk (three-dimensional) fluids, understanding this viscosity enhancement is a
classic problem in hydrodynamics that originated over a century ago with
einstein's study of a dilute suspension of spherical particles.
\cite{einstein1} in this paper, we investigate the analogous problem of the
effective viscosity of a suspension of disks embedded in a two-dimensional
membrane or interface. unlike the hydrodynamics of bulk fluids, low-reynolds
number membrane hydrodynamics is characterized by an inherent length scale
generated by the coupling of the membrane to the bulk fluids that surround it.
as a result, we find that the size of the particles in the suspension relative
to this hydrodynamic length scale has a dramatic effect on the effective
viscosity of the suspension. our study also helps to elucidate the mathematical
tools needed to solve the mixed boundary value problems that generically arise
when considering the motion of rigid inclusions in fluid membranes.

fluid phases to modulated inhomogeneous fluid phases. starting from a
microscopic density functional theory, we develop an order parameter theory for
the phase transition in order to examine in detail the phase behaviour. the
amplitude of the density modulations is the order parameter in our theory. the

random velocity fields, in which the effect of recirculations is modelled by an
oscillatory component in the eulerian time correlation profile. the main issue
we address here is whether fluid velocity fluctuations, in particular the
effect of recirculation, may produce nontrivial corrections to the streaming
particle velocity. our result is that a small (large) degree of recirculation
is associated with a decrease (increase) of streaming with respect to a
quiescent fluid. the presence of this effect is confirmed numerically, away

understanding boundary effects in quantum field theory. in all cases involving

"we consider a mathematical model for the interactions of an elastic body
fully immersed in a viscous, incompressible fluid. the corresponding composite
pde system comprises a linearized navier-stokes system and a dynamic system of
elasticity; the coupling takes place on the interface between the two regions
occupied by the fluid and the solid, respectively. we specifically study the
regularity of boundary traces (on the interface) for the fluid velocity field.
the obtained trace regularity theory for the fluid component of the system --
of interest in its own right -- establishes, in addition, solvability of the
associated optimal (quadratic) control problems on a finite time interval,
along with well-posedness of the corresponding operator differential riccati

analytically the navier stokes equations with partial slip boundary conditions
at the solid fluid interface, we develop a theoretical approach justifying and
extending these earlier findings. we show in particular that in the perfect
slip regime the above mentioned results are, in the plane-plane configuration,
very general and robust with respect to lever geometry considerations. we
compare the results with those obtained previously for the sphere moving
perpendicularly and close to a plane in a simple fluid and discuss in more
details the differences concerning the dependence of the friction forces with
the gap distance separating the moving object (i.e., plane or sphere) from the
fixed plane. finally, we show that the submicron fluidic effect reported in the

the chemical potential, two equally stable films, a thin one and a thick one,
can coexist. as saturation is approached, the thickness of the thick film tends
to infinity. this allows the construction of a liquid-gas interface that forms

equations arising in simulations of fluid/particle flows. the scheme is
intended to work robustly in the lubrication regime when the distance between
two particles immersed in the fluid or between a particle and the wall tends to
zero. the idea consists in introducing a small threshold for the particle-wall
distance below which the real trajectory of the particle is replaced by an
approximated one where the distance is kept equal to the threshold value. the
error of this approximation is estimated both theoretically and by numerical
experiments. our time marching scheme can be easily incorporated into a full
simulation method where the velocity of the fluid is obtained by a numerical
solution to stokes or navier-stokes equations. we also provide a derivation of
the asymptotic expansion for the lubrication force (used in our numerical
experiments) acting on a disk immersed in a newtonian fluid and approaching the

"arnold showed that the euler equations of an ideal fluid describe geodesics
on the lie algebra of incompressible vector fields. we generalize this to
fluids with dissipation and gaussian random forcing. the dynamics is determined
by the structure constants of a lie algebra, along with inner products defining
kinetic energy, ohmic dissipation and the covariance of the forces. this allows
us to construct tractable toy models for fluid mechanics with a finite number
of degrees of freedom. we solve one of them to show how symmetries can be
broken spontaneously.in another direction, we derive a deterministic equation
that describes the most likely path connecting two points in the phase space of
a randomly forced system: this is a wkb approximation to the
fokker-plank-kramer equation, analogous to the instantons of quantum theory.

"we have produced loose packings of cohesionless, frictional spheres by
sequential deposition of highly-spherical, monodisperse particles through a

identified the stokes number (st) - rather than the buoyancy of the particles
in the fluid - as the parameter controlling the approach to the loose packing
limit. the loose packing limit is attained at a threshold value of st at which
the kinetic energy of a particle impinging on the packing is fully dissipated
by the fluid. thus, for cohesionless particles, the dynamics of the deposition
process, rather than the stability of the static packing, defines the random
loose packing limit. we have made direct measurements of the interparticle
friction in the fluid, and present an experimental measurement of the loose

different external forces can be scaled onto a common curve. we try to explain

the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio of the fluid takes the universal

"close to sinusoidal substrates, simple fluids may undergo a filling
transition, in which the fluid passes from a dry to a filled state, where the
interface remains unbent but bound to the substrate. increasing the surface
field, the interface unbinds and a wetting transition occurs. we show that this
double-transition sequence may be strongly modified in the case of ordered
fluids, such as nematic liquid crystals. depending on the preferred orientation
of the nematic molecules at the structured substrate and at the
isotropic-nematic interface, the filling transition may not exist, and the
fluid passes directly from a dry to a complete-wet state, with the interface
far from the substrate. more interestingly, in other situations, the complete
wetting transition may be prevented, and the fluid passes from a dry to a
filled state, and remains in this configuration, with the interface always
attached to the substrate, even for very large surface fields. both transitions
are only observed for a same substrate in a narrow range of amplitudes.

make the model work for unshocked compressible fluids, a key step is to modify
the collision operators of energy flux so that the viscous coefficient in

magnetically-driven plate-like artificial cilia in microchannels using
numerical simulations. the simulations are performed using a coupled
magneto-mechanical solid-fluid computational model that captures the physical
interactions between the fluid flow, ciliary deformation and applied magnetic
field. when a rotating magnetic field is applied to super-paramagnetic
artificial cilia, they mimic the asymmetric motion of natural cilia, consisting
of an effective and recovery stroke. when a phase-difference is prescribed
between neighbouring cilia, metachronal waves develop. due to the discrete
nature of the cilia, the metachronal waves change direction when the phase
difference becomes sufficiently large, resulting in antiplectic as well as
symplectic metachrony. we show that the fluid flow created by the artificial
cilia is significantly enhanced in the presence of metachronal waves and that
the fluid flow becomes unidirectional. antiplectic metachrony is observed to
lead to a considerable enhancement in flow compared to symplectic metachrony,
when the cilia spacing is small. obstruction of flow in the direction of the
effective stroke for the case of symplectic metachrony was found to be the key
mechanism that governs this effect.

equivalent to the existence of a functional on the set of paths that is
decaying along paths. this result falls short of a converse lyapunov theorem in
that no state dependent lyapunov function is constructed. in this paper we
construct state-dependent lyapunov functions in contrast to path-wise

only on the shape of the experimentally measured time-dependent rheological
response function, independent of the constitutive law and internal state

"the response of shear thickening fluids (stfs) under ballistic impact has
received considerable attention due to its field-responsive nature. while
efforts have primarily focused on the response of traditional ballistic fabrics
impregnated with fluids, the response of pure stfs to penetration has received
limited attention. in the present study, the ballistic response of pure stfs is
investigated and the effect of fluid density and particle strength on ballistic
performance is isolated. the loss of ballistic resistance of stfs at higher
impact velocities is governed by particle strength, indicating the range of

of such spacetime as seen by a congruence of observers with respect to which

associated to the four-velocity of the fluid assigned by tilted observers are
studied in detail. as it happens for the case of the lemaitre--tolman--bondi

production) and is nongeodesic. however unlike that later case, the tilted
observer detects vorticity in the congruence of the fluid world lines. also, as
for the nontilted congruence the magnetic part of the weyl tensor vanishes,
reinforcing the nonradiative character of this kind of spacetime. possible

"recent experiments have shown that when a near-hemispherical lipid vesicle
attached to a solid surface is subjected to a simple shear flow it exhibits a
pattern of membrane circulation much like a dipole vortex. this is in marked
contrast to the toroidal circulation that would occur in the related problem of
a drop of immiscible fluid attached to a surface and subjected to shear. this
profound difference in flow patterns arises from the lateral incompressibility
of the membrane, which restricts the observable flows to those in which the
velocity field in the membrane is two-dimensionally divergence free. here we
study these circulation patterns within the simplest model of membrane fluid
dynamics. a systematic expansion of the flow field based on papkovich--neuber

demonstrated in a little bottle. the rotating flow provides a pressure increase
in the outer part of the rotating flow by its centrifugal force. when a
gradient of the fluid rotation appears along the rotation axis, the
higher-pressure area is localized and pushes the fluid in a low pressure. then
the fluid staying in the central area of the rotation is pushed up along the
rotation axis, and the upward wind is enhanced. in this coupling mechanism the

hydrodynamic interactions for a system of two particles in a fluid are
estimated by the velocity correlation of the particles. in an incompressible
fluid, hydrodynamic interactions propagate instantaneously at the infinite
speed of sound, followed by the temporal evolution of viscous diffusion. on the
other hand, in a compressible fluid, sound propagates at a finite speed, which
affects the temporal evolution of the hydrodynamic interactions by the order of
magnitude relation between the time scales of viscous diffusion and sound

"the goal of the paper is to determine boundary conditions in pde models of
collisions of microswimmers in a viscous fluid. we consider two self-propelled
spheres (microswimmers) moving towards each other in viscous fluid. we first
show that under commonly used no-slip boundary conditions on the fluid-solid
interface the microswimmers do not collide which is a generalization of the
well-known no-collision paradox for solid bodies (with no self-propulsion) in a
viscous fluid. secondly, we show that the microswimmers do collide when the
no-slip boundary conditions are replaced by the navier boundary conditions
which therefore provides an adequate model of microswimmers such as swimming
bacteria. the self-propulsion mechanism generates a drag force pulling a
bacterium backwards and the collision problem is reduced to the analysis of
competition between the drag and self-propulsion. for no-slip this is done by
utilizing the lorentz reciprocal theorem and the analytical solution for two
solid spheres in the fluid. the analysis for the navier boundary conditions is
based on the variational formulation of stokes problem. a poincare type
inequality for symmetrized gradient is introduced in this work.

here demonstrate for a model system of such complex fluids that at high shear
rates turbulence is not simply modified as previously believed but it is
suppressed and replaced by a new type of disordered motion, elasto-inertial
turbulence (eit). eit is found to occur at much lower reynolds numbers than
newtonian turbulence and the dynamical properties differ significantly. in
particular the drag is strongly reduced and the observed friction scaling
resolves a longstanding puzzle in non-newtonian fluid mechanics regarding the
nature of the so-called maximum drag reduction asymptote. theoretical

the time-reversible euler equation, an experimenter who only controls the
pressure in a pump attached to the tube would see jets form in one direction
exclusively. the asymmetry between outflow and inflow therefore does not depend
on viscous dissipation, but rather on the experimenter's limited control of

interactions between the swimmer and nearby objects lead to many interesting
phenomena, such as changes in swimming speed, tendencies to accumulate or turn,
and coordinated flagellar beating. inspired by this class of problems, we
investigate locomotion of microorganisms near deformable boundaries. we
calculate the speed of an infinitely long swimmer close to a flexible surface
separating two fluids; we also calculate the deformation and swimming speed of

computations. the poisson network model, for which the base stations (bs)
locations form a spatial poisson process, allows to consider a non constant

by using scaling arguments, we argue that a four-point correlation length
$\xi_4(t)$ grows linearly in time in a glass and grows as $\sqrt{t}$ at long
times in a fluid, and we verify these results by analyzing $s_4(q;t)$ obtained
from simulations. for a viscoelastic fluid, the simulation results suggest that
the crossover to the long-time $\sqrt{t}$ growth of $\xi_4(t)$ occurs at a
characteristic decay time of the shear stress autocorrelation function. using
this observation, we show that the amplitude of the long-time $\sqrt{t}$ growth

"a comprehensive scheme for the spatial discretisation of continuity equation,

presented for numerically simulating the incompressible two phase flows based
on the finite volume and volume of fluid methods. the scheme uses the mass
conservation for the advection of the interface between the two fluids,

finite volume so that it is consistent with that for the advection of the
interfaces, and correctly accounts for the contributions to the normal and
shear stresses from the viscosities of the two fluids. an interface
reconstruction method is also presented, which approximates the local interface
by a second order surface. the reconstruction method is based on the local
average height function. it is linear and mathematically consistent. the force
due to the surface tension is calculated based on the local surface area,

"turbulent channel flows laden with particles are investigated using direct
numerical simulation with a point-force approximation for small, heavy
particles with a diameter smaller than the kolmogorov length scale of the
fluid. the stokes numbers based on the wall units considered in our study are
$st^+=0.5, 5, 35$ and 125. the main purpose of this study is to examine the
effect of stokes number on turbulence modification in a channel. we found that
particles with $st^+=0.5$ enhance turbulence by increasing the occurrence of
quasistreamwise vortices, while larger-stokes-number particles attenuate
turbulence. when $st^+=0.5$, kinetic energy is transferred from the particles
to streamwise fluid velocity fluctuations in the high-speed regions and
low-speed streaks, which may increase the instability of the low-speed streaks
responsible for the birth of new quasistreamwise vortices. on the other hand,
the preferential concentration of larger-stokes-number particles in low-speed
streaks is responsible for turbulence attenuation, and the slow response of the
particles to the fluid produces feedback against the fluid velocity associated
with quasistreamwise vortices.

"we use a series of molecular dynamics simulations, and analytical theory, to
demonstrate that a system of hard spheres confined to a narrow cylindrical
channel exhibits a continuous phase transition from an isotropic fluid at low
densities, to an orientationally ordered, but translationally disordered,
helical fluid at high densities. the ordered fluid phase contains small
sections of helix separated by topological defects that change the direction of
the twist, altering the local chirailty. the defects break up the translational
order, but the fluid develops long range orientational order. an analysis of
the particle packings show that the length separation between defects controls
the geometrical properties of the helical sections, including the orientation,
and that pairs of defects experience a weak, but long range attraction
resulting from entropic free volumes effects. these collective long range
interactions overcome the restrictions on quasi-one-dimensional transitions,
even though the particle-particle interaction is short ranged.

"quantum mechanics has been argued to be a coarse-graining of some underlying
deterministic theory. here we support this view by establishing a map between
certain solutions of the schroedinger equation, and the corresponding solutions
of the irrotational navier-stokes equation for viscous fluid flow. as a
physical model for the fluid itself we propose the quantum probability fluid.
it turns out that the (state-dependent) viscosity of this fluid is proportional
to planck's constant, while the volume density of entropy is proportional to
boltzmann's constant. stationary states have zero viscosity and a vanishing
time rate of entropy density. on the other hand, the nonzero viscosity of
nonstationary states provides an information-loss mechanism whereby a
deterministic theory (a classical fluid governed by the navier-stokes equation)
gives rise to an emergent theory (a quantum particle governed by the
schroedinger equation).

"he inhomogeneous structure of a fluid at a wall can be characterized in
several ways. within a thermodynamic description the surface free energy
$\gamma$ and the excess adsorption $\gamma$ are of central importance. for
theoretical studies closed expression of $\gamma$ and $\gamma$ can be very
valuable; however, even for a well-studied model system such as a hard-sphere
fluid at a planar hard wall, the accuracy of existing expressions for $\gamma$
and $\gamma$, compared to precise computer simulation data, can still be
improved. here, we compare several known expressions for $\gamma$ and $\gamma$
to the most precise computer simulation data. while good agreement is generally
found at low to intermediate fluid densities, the existing parameterizations
show significant deviation at high density. in this work, we propose new
parameterizations for $\gamma$ and $\gamma$ that agree with the simulation data
within statistical error over the entire fluid density range.

"the invasion of one fluid into another of higher viscosity in a quasi-two
dimensional geometry typically produces complex fingering patterns. because
interfacial tension suppresses short-wavelength fluctuations, its elimination
by using pairs of miscible fluids would suggest an instability producing highly
ramified singular structures. previous studies focused on wavelength selection
at the instability onset and overlooked the striking features appearing more
globally. here we investigate the non-linear growth that occurs after the
instability has been fully established. we find a rich variety of patterns that
are characterized by the viscosity ratio between the inner and the outer fluid,
$\eta_{in}$/$\eta_{out}$, as distinct from the most-unstable wavelength, which
determines the onset of the instability. as $\eta_{in}$/$\eta_{out}$ increases,
a regime dominated by long highly-branched fractal fingers gives way to one
dominated by blunt stable structures characteristic of proportionate growth.
simultaneously, a central region of complete outer-fluid displacement grows

"recent experiments showed that standing acoustic waves could be exploited to
induce self-propulsion of rigid metallic particles in the direction
perpendicular to the acoustic wave. we propose in this paper a physical
mechanism for these observations based on the interplay between inertial forces
in the fluid and the geometrical asymmetry of the particle shape. we consider
an axisymmetric rigid near-sphere oscillating in a quiescent fluid along a
direction perpendicular to its symmetry axis. the kinematics of oscillations
can be either prescribed or can result dynamically from the presence of an
external oscillating velocity field. steady streaming in the fluid, the
inertial rectification of the time-periodic oscillating flow, generates steady
stresses on the particle which, in general, do not average to zero, resulting
in a finite propulsion speed along the axis of the symmetry of the particle and
perpendicular to the oscillation direction. our derivation of the propulsion
speed is obtained at leading order in the reynolds number and the deviation of
the shape from that of a sphere. the results of our model are consistent with
the experimental measurements, and more generally explains how time periodic
forcing from an acoustic field can be harnessed to generate autonomous motion.

"gravitational waves from neutron-star and black-hole binaries carry valuable
information on their physical properties and probe physics inaccessible to the
laboratory. although development of black-hole gravitational-wave templates in
the past decade has been revolutionary, the corresponding work for double
neutron-star systems has lagged. neutron stars can be well-modelled as simple
barotropic fluids during the part of binary inspiral most relevant to
gravitational wave astronomy, but the crucial geometric and mathematical
consequences of this simplification have remained computationally unexploited.
in particular, carter and lichnerowicz have described barotropic fluid motion
via classical variational principles as conformally geodesic. moreover,
kelvin's circulation theorem implies that initially irrotational flows remain
irrotational. applied to numerical relativity, these concepts lead to novel
hamiltonian or hamilton-jacobi schemes for evolving relativistic fluid flows.
hamiltonian methods can conserve not only flux, but also circulation and
symplecticity, and moreover do not require addition of an artificial atmosphere
typically required by standard conservative methods. these properties can allow
production of high-precision gravitational waveforms at low computational cost.
this canonical hydrodynamics approach is applicable to a wide class of problems

"the dynamics of spherical particles driven along an interface between two
immiscible fluids is investigated asymptotically. under the assumptions of a

deformation of the fluid interface which is also computed. the case of two
interacting driven particles is studied via the linear superposition
approximation. it is shown that the capillary interaction force resulting from
the particle motion is dipolar in terms of the azimuthal angle and decays with
the fifth power of the inter-particle separation, similar to a capillary
quadrupole originating from undulations of the three-phase contact line. the

small velocities, where the superfluid is already turbulent, the flow of the
normal fluid remains laminar, but with a distorted velocity profile, while at a
higher velocity there is a transition to turbulence. the form of the structure
function in this turbulent state differs significantly from that found in types

the new dissipative terms are discussed in terms of both standard resistive
magnetohydrodynamics and small-scale structure formation in networks of cosmic

barotropic fluid. evolving wormhole solutions are obtained when isotropic fluid
is phantom in nature and there is a big rip singularity at the end. here the
dissipative phenomena is due to the particle creation mechanism in
non-equilibrium thermodynamics. using the process to be adiabatic, the
dissipative pressure is expressed linearly to the particle creation rate. for
two choices of the particle creation rate as a function of the hubble

interactions replace the no-slip conditions. the impact of grid resolution is
explored and the observed structures are seen to be dependant on averaging time
and length scales. the kinetic energy spectra show a range of scales are
present in the molecular system and that spectral content is dependent on the
grid resolution employed. the subgrid velocity of the molecules is compared to
spatial averaged velocity using joint probability density functions. molecular
trajectories, diffusions and lagrangian statistics are presented. the
importance of sub-grid scales, relevance of the kolmogorov lengthscale and
implications of molecular turbulence are discussed.

"the non-relativistic covariant framework for fields is extended to
investigate fields and fluids on scale covariant curved backgrounds. the scale
covariant newton-cartan background is constructed using the localization of
spacetime symmetries of non-relativistic fields in flat space. following this,
we provide a weyl covariant formalism which can be used to study scale
invariant fluids. by considering ideal fluids as an example, we describe its
thermodynamic and hydrodynamic properties and explicitly demonstrate that it
satisfies the local second law of thermodynamics. as a further application, we
consider the low energy description of hall fluids. specifically, we find that
the gauge fields for scale transformations lead to corrections of the wen-zee
and berry phase terms contained in the effective action.

"a kinetic-fluid model describing the evolutions of disperse two-phase flows
is considered. the model consists of the vlasov-fokker-planck equation for the
particles (disperse phase) coupled with the compressible navier-stokes
equations for the fluid (fluid phase) through the friction force. the friction
force depends on the density, which is different from many previous studies on
kinetic-fluid models and is more physical in modeling but significantly more
difficult in analysis. new approach and techniques are introduced to deal with
the strong coupling of the fluid and the particles. the global well-posedness
of strong solution in the three-dimensional whole space is established when the
initial data is a small perturbation of some given equilibrium. moreover, the
algebraic rate of convergence of solution toward the equilibrium state is
obtained. for the periodic domain the same global well-posedness result still
holds while the convergence rate is exponential.

"bacteria predate plants and animals by billions of years. today, they are the
world's smallest cells yet they represent the bulk of the world's biomass, and
the main reservoir of nutrients for higher organisms. most bacteria can move on
their own, and the majority of motile bacteria are able to swim in viscous
fluids using slender helical appendages called flagella. low-reynolds-number
hydrodynamics is at the heart of the ability of flagella to generate propulsion
at the micron scale. in fact, fluid dynamic forces impact many aspects of
bacteriology, ranging from the ability of cells to reorient and search their
surroundings to their interactions within mechanically and chemically-complex
environments. using hydrodynamics as an organizing framework, we review the
biomechanics of bacterial motility and look ahead to future challenges.

"we compute the hydrodynamic torque on a dumbbell (two spheres linked by a
massless rigid rod) settling in a quiescent fluid at small but finite reynolds
number. the spheres have the same mass densities but different sizes. when the
sizes are quite different the dumbbell settles vertically, aligned with the
direction of gravity, the largest sphere first. but when the size difference is
sufficiently small then its steady-state angle is determined by a competition
between the size difference and the reynolds number. when the sizes of the
spheres are exactly equal then fluid inertia causes the dumbbell to settle in a
horizontal orientation.
